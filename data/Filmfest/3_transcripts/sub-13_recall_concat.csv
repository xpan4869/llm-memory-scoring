1,"Okay, so the first movie was Catch me if you can with Leonardo di Caprio and it starts with 3, with a like a TV show, a game show I guess, with 3 men, all of them wearing the same clothes and kind of like a briefcase, and Leonardo di Caprio's in the middle. And I guess the premise is that they are all 3 they are con men, and they go by the same name, they are Frank something Abagnale. And they have different professions and lead different lives but they're all the same man.",1,31,96
2,"And so in this talk show I guess, this woman is asking them questions, and she asks the first man, why, you know being as smart as he is, why he chose to be a con man, and he answered, the answer was about the money. The second question was to the second man, the man in the middle, Leonardo di Caprio, um, and the question was who caught you? And the answer was he gave the name, I don't remember, and then they flashbacked to that, I guess, cop telling some other people, and I think it's raining, um, that he is this man like he's telling other people who he is.",1,38,113
3,"And the answer was he gave the name, I don't remember, and then they flashbacked to that, I guess, cop telling some other people, and I think it's raining, um, that he is this man like he's telling other people who he is. I think this was in France, 1969 or something like that, and telling them who he is and he keeps repeating his name. I guess because of his credentials, and um he needs to see Frank Abagnale.",1,27,80
4,"And so he, they let him, and they're very strict about what he can do in this tiny room that is not very good looking, and I guess Frank is in solitary confinement and he's in a cell, and he's coughing, and he's so sick.",1,15,45
5,"And so he, they let him, and they're very strict about what he can do in this tiny room that is not very good looking, and I guess Frank is in solitary confinement and he's in a cell, and he's coughing, and he's so sick. And I guess the cop person wants to take him back to the United States for some reason and he's reading this document to him, I guess it's something legal, and Frank is just coughing and coughing and coughing and then he passes out. And the cop freaks out and says you need to call the cops. Also he's carrying an umbrella because it's dripping in this cell place.",1,37,114
6,"Um and they call the doctor or whatever, not really the doctor actually, but they take him to the hospital and then they want to leave him there overnight. The cop is like what are you guys doing? And they're washing their hands and they're like oh the doctor comes in the morning, or something like that, and then, and then they see, and he's so upset because he needs to take him back home he says to the United States soon and he's so sick. And then they see that he has escaped that room, except they chase after him and he can't go very fast because he's so sick, so he's like actually just crawling and coughing his way out.",1,30,122
7,"And then they see that he has escaped that room, except they chase after him and he can't go very fast because he's so sick, so he's like actually just crawling and coughing his way out. And I guess the cop grabs him by the hair and he just passes out, facing up, and actually kind of smiles. I think, I mean he knows he's done.",1,17,66
8,"Um and so this red-headed cartoon character sits on the couch, sits on this chair, and opens this envelope that has this uh what's it called, vinyl music, this disc, and she also has this slice of pizza in her hand.",1,16,41
9,"So she's going to eat this pizza but then, plays the music, but then notices that as the music goes on, her pizza gets eaten. And then she realizes that she can play, she can play with time through this disc. So she does. So she goes forward in time, she goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, kind of like short range, so kind of like, I don't know, within the same day, like her pizza gets eaten and then comes back and then eaten and comes back and then eaten and then come back.",1,23,99
10,"But then she goes to later age, so she becomes like pregnant, and then she has a baby.",1,7,18
11,"And she can keep going back and forth, and then she becomes like older and then she's on a wheelchair and then she becomes younger and she has a doll in her hand, and she's like a kid.",1,8,38
12,"And she can keep going back and forth, and then she becomes like older and then she's on a wheelchair and then she becomes younger and she has a doll in her hand, and she's like a kid.",1,8,38
13,"And then, she pushes it so far that she's dead.",1,2,10
14,"Okay so there's this, it starts with something about ambition, I don't know why it said ambitious on the screen, it said it, in text, but anyway, this woman and this man are at the dinner table and they're like wealthy, I don't know, they're having this fancy dinner, the kind of dinner that like one of them is on one side of the long table and the other on the other, and they're eating like asparagus and you can hear like the click, like the clicking of the like fork and knife as they cut their food.",1,24,98
15,"And they're being very like formal, and they're referring to each other as dear and it's their anniversary. And she's clearly very, well she's very upset because she wants to pour him wine, and he can't because he's on call. I guess he's a doctor or something. And then he's like you know I can't drink when I'm on call, and she's so upset and she just chugs her wine and then pours herself another glass, and she's so disappointed in him, and he is like, the asparagus is so tender, dear. And she's like yeah, it's an aphrodisiac, and he's like, why do you say that, and she's like, well that's just what people say.",1,30,116
16,"And he's like oh, and she's sooo angry at him because I guess she wants to have sex, and he's so cold or something. And then she's like, she like pours her water glass on his face, and he's so angry and he starts smoking.",1,13,45
17,"And then she's like, she like pours her water glass on his face, and he's so angry and he starts smoking. She also, she's like uh just like I don't even know why you can't drink, going from stupid dinner to stupid conversation, stilted conversation, if I'm lucky, to make short mechanical sex,  which ended up being interesting, because, well that's when he starts smoking and she's so upset, she's like you do NOT smoke in my house, and puts out his cigarette.But he lights another one.",1,26,88
18,"And she's so angry, but then she goes over to him, and she's like I'm so sorry for what I said, probably referring to the sex comment, I'm so sorry I didn't mean it, and she's massaging his head, caressing his head, and then, turns him off.",1,9,47
19,"And she's so angry, but then she goes over to him, and she's like I'm so sorry for what I said, probably referring to the sex comment, I'm so sorry I didn't mean it, and she's massaging his head, caressing his head, and then, turns him off. Okay, so he's a robot, so that's weird. And then she goes, like just lets go and like just puts her feet on the dinner table.",1,16,73
20,"And then actually goes online, or to her computer, and actually checks out another robot. So now she's thinking about getting another robot, and this one is clearly just like not as um I don't know, formal-looking as the last one. Um I don't know if his name was Paul or something, anyways, she calls this company, robot company, and she's like oh I'm not satisfied with my current product. And they're like oh I'm so sorry, what's the problem, she's like, oh I don't remember what she said but I don't remember what she said, but it was something like he lacks a sense of adventure or something. And they're like, oh yeah that's a common problem or fault or with that model. Uh so do you want an upgrade to a different model? And she's like yes please. Ok well do you know what you want? And she's like I want a, somebody with a sense of adventure, right?Like a rock climber or a masseuse, ooh can it be a rock-climbing masseuse? And they're like yeah yeah no problem.",1,49,181
21,"So they bring in a new robot, these two like blonde chicks bring in a new, you know formal-looking, I feel like we're in the future now, I mean, and then, by the way, everybody has an accent in this movie. And then, they bring in this other man, this other robot man, and he's off, but I guess she turns him on. Also she is like, wait, before they leave, and takes off his ring, gives him a kiss in the lips and lets them take the old robot. And then she puts on the ring on the new robot, like the wedding ring, and wakes him up, or you know, turns him on.",1,31,115
22,"And now they're having dinner. And it's kind of similar, it's weird, because he's also commenting on how the asparagus is tender, but then HE is like oh I hear it's an aphrodisiac. And she smiles. Oh also before that, she offers wine and he's like no I have a big climb tomorrow, which is very interesting,  Um so he's like no I have a big climb tomorrow, I can't drink, and she's like oh, God. But then he makes a comment about the aphrodisiac and she's like oh okay maybe this is better, and then he comes over and starts massaging her, which is the masseuse part, right, and she's so happy.",1,25,114
23,"But then he makes a comment about the aphrodisiac and she's like oh okay maybe this is better, and then he comes over and starts massaging her, which is the masseuse part, right, and she's so happy. And he's like how was your day, tell me about your day, which is the same thing that the other guy asked, which is also interesting. She starts telling him about her day, and goes on and on about how she went into town, and whatever, oh had lunch with Anna, and since it was their anniversary, and then, he turns her off.",1,24,100
24,"So she was a robot. And then he just kicks back on the couch, and smokes.",1,3,16
25,It was on the side of the road. So how did the shoe get there?,1,3,15
26,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was drinking a carton of milk, by a car, and then he somehow has to leave because somebody is coming or something, I think somebody scares him away, and then he notices this woman.",1,11,38
27,"So then there's this, goes to this guy who's walking around the sidewalk and notices that this woman on the other side of the sidewalk is kind of doing everything that he does, and it's very playful. So the guy kind of trips, and she trips too. He reaches up, oh he's drinking milk actually.  He puts the carton of milk up like up high, and the woman also reaches up high. He starts kind of skipping or dancing, and she starts doing it too. And then it flips, so she starts doing something and he imitates. But then, he's not paying attention to the road, because he's paying attention to her, and then she's trying to, she's trying to signal to him, that there's a car coming, but he thinks it's fun and games and then he gets hit by a car.",1,35,144
28,"His shoe flies off, and that's how that shoe got there.",1,2,11
29,,0,,0
30,"Alright, I think that was the punch line, but what happened is this guy is super excited. He works at an office, like I don't know, he has like an office job, a day job, and he's like been there for a while but he you know, he's not, he doesn't have a great position, and he's like the most senior junior person. But it's promotion day, and he's pretty sure he's going to get the promotion, probably because he's been there for so long. He also, turns out, has a crush on this girl, who's also a stick figure, everybody's a stick figure, that works on a different floor. He makes her coffee a lot, like she actually doesn't want the coffee. She actually, I don't know how this is relevant, but she pours it out of the window, and actually I think kills the guy that is working on this ladder on the side of the window.",1,37,159
31,,0,,0
32,"Anyway, the guy, the main character, whose name I can't remember, goes upstairs and finds out that he did not get the promotion because this other guy got it. This other guy then goes to the fourth floor I think, where his, the lady is, and they start kissing. The main guy is still upset that he didn't get the promotion, but is also obsessed with this girl, so he wants to go see if she wants another coffee. He takes the elevator down, turns out the guy that got the promotion instead is there, talking to this lady, and they are kissing.",1,32,103
33,"So he's just in shock and also the elevator door just takes forever to close. They're still kissing. And then, he asks the guy in the elevator, you know, the main guy, to leave the elevator door open for him. So now they're sharing the elevator door, or the elevator. And he can see his reflection in the mirror looking back at him, and he actually says to him well, three words that he, I guess regrets, but I'm guessing is go fuck yourself,  anyway, the guy hits him, and the main guy hits him back, but so much, so aggressively, that he kills him.",1,32,106
34,"And then, he decides that he needs to hide the body. He decides to take the elevator, the stairs I think, because the elevator, well that would be, he would probably get caught. Turns out as he's going down the stairs, this lady decides to go to the bathroom upstairs better she likes it better because it has better soap. She also made a resolution to take the stairs, exercise more, I don't know if I made that up. Anyway, she's taking the stairs up, she sees the guy and the dead body, mutilated body, and faints and also dies, because she faints on the stairwell, but the main guy is like, oh well, that was an accident, like not my fault.",1,33,122
35,"Anyway he decides that he should not be taking the stairs. He decides that he should be taking those weirdo stairs outside of the window, outside of the building, and as he's doing that, he actually drops the mutilated guy and he's just balancing there.",1,10,45
36,"And I guess the punch line is everything is so fragile and you never know what's going to happen next. And everybody wants the same thing I guess just like happiness.Everything can change in the blink of an eye. He decides that he should be taking those weirdo stairs outside of the window, outside of the building, and as he's doing that, he actually drops the mutilated guy and he's just balancing there. And that's where he sees the cleaning man. And he realizes that you know, that's when the punch line comes in like, everybody just wants the same thing, everybody just wants to be happy, and wants a house, whatever.",1,25,112
37,"So it starts being a mountain and it transforms, transforms, transforms with time. It has eyes, so this is also an animated movie. And yeah, just we follow the life of this rock, this mountain, as it goes on and on and on with time and it goes to different places with technology, and in the end it goes into space, so.",1,18,62

60,"Well there's a really weird movie with a guy, was wearing these white headphones and kinda looks terrible, he's wearing like sweatpants and is sweating, and he's carrying a bag that has ice cream and it's kind of melting, and he's waiting there. The movie's called the Bus Stop even though, I guess he was waiting for the bus. All of a sudden this woman is in this car, and like gets out of the car, and leaves the door open, and she, I don't know if she wanted to use this payphone, anyway, she comes to talk to this man and asks him if he has a phone. Meanwhile her car has been I think moving the entire time, anyway.",1,30,121

And she's like don't worry, I'm not going to take it, blah blah blah. He gives her a phone and she's like yelling on the cell phone, I'm going to call the cops, blah blah blah, this and that, and then she's so angry and she slams the phone on the floor.",1,24,102
62,"The guy, the guy is just kind of standing there the entire time even though he sees his phone smashed on the floor, and then he comes, he goes, and checks it, and he's like it's broken. And the woman just doesn't pay attention to him at all, but he's, he doesn't seem so upset, but he just follows her because he wants money, he wants her to pay him 60 dollars for the phone so he can get a new phone. ",1,7,83
63,"Eventually this car pulls in, and this guy comes out of the car, and the woman is walking towards the man and the main guy at the, with the headphones, is following the woman. This guy gets out of the car and he starts interacting with the woman.",1,13,48
64,"The old man, he's an older man, and he's clearly upset that this other guy is there, he's like, what do you know about me, blah blah blah, and she's like, nobody knows who you are, and they're having a heated, well she's very upset,  and the guy's like no no no I don't know who, oh, the girl's like oh he's just a friend and he's like mehh, not really, I just want money for my phone, I don't know anything. Anyway, the old man, oh the main guy is like oh I know who you are, you're a magician and you're the assistant.",1,23,106
65,"And then, she takes out like a gun and he takes out a fake gun, the woman is wondering where somebody is, she's like where is she where is she, what did you do to her, something like that. And um meanwhile they're like pointing guns at each other and then actually the magician guy hypnotizes the main guy, and it doesn't go right, but he ends up turning into a dog.",1,24,72
66,"And um meanwhile they're like pointing guns at each other and then actually the magician guy hypnotizes the main guy, and it doesn't go right, but he ends up turning into a dog. Oh also before, while the guy was being hypnotized, the woman checks the trunk of the car, and is so upset, that's why she shoots the magician.  She's so upset at what she sees in the trunk.",1,22,71
67,"And um meanwhile they're like pointing guns at each other and then actually the magician guy hypnotizes the main guy, and it doesn't go right, but he ends up turning into a dog. His ice cream melted, it's all over the floor, and the two, and the magician shoots the assistant, the assistant shoots the magician. Oh also before, while the guy was being hypnotized, the woman checks the trunk of the car, and is so upset, that's why she shoots the magician.",1,26,83
68,"He ends up behaving like a dog. because when the main guy's a dog, this other woman dog who's wearing what looks like uh the clothes that you would wear at the hospital, like a gown, a hospital gown, is also a dog.And then they're like hanging out.In the end the guy seems happier, because now he has a friend.He just didn't seem very happy before, now I don't know, these two dogs, this woman and this man, are just like hanging out and playing with each other.",1,21,88
