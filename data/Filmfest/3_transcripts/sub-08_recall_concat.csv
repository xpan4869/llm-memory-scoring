1,"So it starts out with this game show in the 70s, something called like To Tell the Truth. And so there are these 3 guys dressed in airline outfits that walk out onto stage and stop at these little T-marks. And one of them is the true person, 2 are impostors, and the point of the game show is for contestants to figure out who’s the right person. And so they walk out onto the stage, and the announcer says something like, or they all introduce themselves as like “I am Frank Abagnale,” and I forget his middle initial or middle name. And then maybe it was the announcer or maybe it was each of them describe one thing they did, and it was like, they were an airline pilot for several years. They were some physician doctor at a Georgia hospital. And then I forget if it was like Louisiana, some sort of lawyer I think. Anyway, and then they walk over to their little podium stand things. And there are these like cool little designs in the back, little figure things. ",1,53,184
2,"Anyway, the contestants ask, one of the contestants asks the first person why’d they do it, and the person is like, “It was truly a dollars and cents thing. I needed the money” basically. And then the contestant asked the second person, who is Leonardo Dicaprio, who is the true Frank. Who chased him? And that’s when he says, “Carl.”",1,20,60
3,"And then it cuts to France, Marseilles, France, and it’s Tom Hanks’ character, Carl Hanratty, talking to the French police, trying to explain his name, and it’s raining and pouring, and he has an umbrella, and everyone’s soaking wet. And it’s like the French police don’t seem to really understand what, what Carl Hanratty is saying. Anyway, so after that, it’s Marseilles, France, 1969, he walk.",1,21,66
4,"He’s in this like jail, and Frank is in the jail in one of the cells, like maximum seclusion. And one of the officers takes Carl to the front of the, Frank’s cell, and says, “Sit here on the stool,” and he opens this little trap door thing, and he's like, “Don’t pass anything through there.”",1,17,56
5,"And Carl sits down, and he starts reading, what’s the word? Like extradition stuff to Frank, because he’s gonna take him back to the U.S., because, well you don’t know this at that part, but later on in the movie you find out that he’s arrested by the police for printing money. Anyway, I won’t get into that, but anyway he's going, getting, you know that he's getting extradited back to the U.S. And while Carl is reading the extradition laws, Frank is coughing. Eventually he falls over, and while he’s coughing, Carl’s like, “You're not fooling me.” But then Frank eventually tips over, and Carl tosses away his stool and yells at the French policeman to like open the gate. “This guy’s sick. Get him a doctor.”",1,34,128
6,"And it cuts to like the police officers dumping Frank on a cot in like a sort of medical ward part of the prison.  And then they start rinsing their hands, and Carl’s like, “What are you doing?” and all the officers are like, “We’re getting rid of the lice.” And Carl’s like, “He needs to see a doctor,” and they're like, “Well the doctor can see him in the morning.” I forget if they say in the morning or, you know, after the weekend or something. So they begin to argue a little bit, but then the camera pans over to an open door.  And so like Frank has slipped through the door.",1,25,116
7,"The next scene is Frank running down the hallway of a prison, but he's like kind of limping and falling all over the place, so he's trying to escape, he wasn’t faking that, he really was sick. Anyway, the police officers and Carl walk up to him. And the head guy, the French police, holds like a pistol to the top of Frank’s head, and Frank just stops there, and like falls, like kind of leans down and lies on his back, back spread over, and he’s like, “Okay, Carl, you can take me home.”",1,25,95
8,"It’s like sort of Claymation, and it’s this young lady, who is about to eat some pizza, and she gets a knock on her door. And she opens the door, and all that’s there is this manila envelope. And in the manila envelope, she opens it, and there's a record.",1,12,50
9,"So she, it’s a small, it’s like a 7-inch, so she puts the record on. She has a record player conveniently next to her pizza, and she starts playing it. And she's about to like take a bite of the pizza, and the pizza like has disappeared, like halfway disappeared. And she notices this, and she like looks at the record, and then she like reruns, she like sort of like rotates the, you know, the record around to like sort of rewind it. And the pizza comes back, and then she like fast forwards, and the pizza goes away, and she does that back and forth a couple times. And now I'm forgetting the lyrics of the song, but it’s something like, “Don’t rush” or “Take your time,” which is obviously directly related to what the record is doing, fast-forwarding and rewinding time relative to like where in the song the needle is.",1,40,154
10,"So then she like skips ahead, and it’s to the point where you like see a picture frame, she's married. And then it like pans down, and she's pregnant, and she like fast forwards and rewinds, and her stomach like grows and shrinks. And then she, you know, skips ahead a little bit, and the baby pops like into her arms. And she seems like pretty pleased at that point, and like this is pretty cool.",1,16,76
11,"And then she like, I think that’s when she rewinds, and she's like back to a little kid. And like every time it sort of jumps in time, the record player is there, and like she had the baby when she was older, but now as a kid, she has like a little doll in her hand. And so then she has to, but she's like really short, so she like goes on her tippy toes to like reach and like move the record needle.",1,16,85
12,"And then she skips ahead a lot, and she’s older. And she's like broken her leg I think in a wheelchair, and she's like wheeling the wheelchair over, but then of course the record skips, and so it like rewinds, and that goes back and forth a couple times, which is like pretty clever.",1,14,54
13,"And then, and then I think it just, I forget if she bumps the record player or something, but it skips ahead, and she's much older, and there's a walker. But obviously like after a second or two she realizes, “Oh man, the record’s almost done playing.” And so she's like trying in the walker to get to the record player in time, but then the record ends, and she, you know, she changes into an urn.",1,16,77
14,"It was like at nighttime, and this lady and what seems to be her boyfriend, or husband, they're eating dinner, and it’s their anniversary. And they're like sitting, it’s like a rectangle table, and they're like sitting at the ends. and weirdly, I guess I skipped this, when the film started, it said, “The Boyfriend,” and then it said something like “high maintenance.”",1,16,63
15,"Anyway, so they're sitting at different ends, and she offers him some white wine, and he's like, “No, I'm on call tonight.” And she's like, kind of like gives a face of annoyance. And then she just downs her glass of wine and fills it up again. Anyway, so then she says something like, “Oh.” Or he says, “The asparagus are really good tonight. They're tender.” And she's like, “Oh I hear they're an aphrodisiac.” And he's like, “Who says that?” as in he doesn’t believe her, and she's like, “I don’t know, just people.” And then he's like, “Okay,” like obviously not reciprocating the sort of like sexual like cute flirtatious talking, so she's like totally not happy about that.",1,39,121
16,"And then I think, I forget like, if it’s right then or shortly afterwards, she's just like, “You know, you’re not even a doctor. You’re like a data, you're a computer person, you know, like what does that mean to be on call?” sort of thing. And then he asks something like, “How was your day?” and then she like tosses the wine at him. And she's like, “You're so stale,”",1,19,71
17,"So he gets upset from the wine tossed on his face and starts lighting a cigarette, and she's like, “Don’t you smoke in my apartment” and takes the cigarette, and then walks and puts it in an ashtray, and then he takes out another one and lights it. And then she just sits back down and looks at him. She says something about, you know, “We’re just gonna have robotic sex,” you know, something, and he gets like really upset about that.",1,20,82
18,"And I don’t think he says anything, and eventually she's like, “I’m sorry,” or I know. She says something about, you know, “We’re just gonna have robotic sex,” you know, something, and he gets like really upset about that. And she's like, “I didn’t mean that,” about the stale sex, and then she's like rubbing the back of his neck, and then she like switches him off.",1,16,67
19,"And she's like, “I didn’t mean that,” about the stale sex, and then she's like rubbing the back of his neck, and then she like switches him off. He's a robot. That’s when you find out he's a robot. And then she goes over to, I think maybe she takes another sip of wine or something, and then she goes over to her Apple computer laptop.",1,16,66
20,"And then she goes over to, I think maybe she takes another sip of wine or something, and then she goes over to her Apple computer laptop. And she's looking online at, it’s like Proteus Robotics and there's a slogan about love for all your love needs or something. Prometheus, not Proteus, Prometheus Robotics: For all your love needs. So it’s like a website for a company, and clearly like this robot was from that company, and she's looking at other models, and she calls up,  and she's like, you know, “I'm not satisfied with my model,” and they're like, “What’s the problem?” and she says something about, “He's not spontaneous or anything,” and they're like, “Oh that’s like the 100 model. Yeah that’s a known defect,” or something. Anyway, she's like, “I'm looking to upgrade,” and they're like, “Well, what do you want?” And she's being a little coy about it, like she knows the one that she wants. And she's being a little coy about it, like she knows the one that she wants. Anyway, so she's like, “Oh maybe a rock climber, or maybe a masseuse, or how about a masseuse and a rock climber?” And then the camera pans out, and clearly like she's describing the guy that she wants, that she’s looking at on the computer.",1,50,222
21,"Anyway, next scene, doorbell rings, she opens it up, and there are these two female delivery people with a box. And clearly it’s the new guy, and so they package up the old guy. And as they're about to take him away, she's like, “Wait.” And I think she like gives him a kiss goodbye and takes off the wedding ring. Anyway, she puts the ring on the new guy’s finger, and then puts him in the chair, and then starts him up, and sits down at the table.",1,19,89
22,"And then there's a delay of a second while he’s sort of like boots up. And then he like turns on, and then he starts eating the asparagus. And he's like, “Ah, the asparagus, they're tender tonight.” And then he's like, “I hear they're an aphrodisiac,” or. There was something that I think he said beforehand that she like, maybe she just, like he said, “The asparagus are tender tonight,” and she's like immediately sort of disappointed, like, “Oh no, here we go again,”  but then he says, oh, yeah he says, “I hear they're an aphrodisiac,” and then her eyes perk up, and she's like, “Oh, who tells you that?” and he's like, “Oh you know, just people.” So they're sort of flirting. And then, oh I know what happened, she offered him white wine first, and he's like, “No, I got a rock climb tomorrow. I can't have any.” And so she was like disappointed from that, but then the asparagus comment perked her up.",1,34,168
23,"So then I forget what, yeah I forget why, but he gets up basically and starts massaging her. And as he's massaging her, I forget, she might’ve said something. And he gets up, and he's like massaging her, and he's like, “Oh, so tell me about your day.” And she starts telling him about his day, and like she saw her girlfriend, and. But then the guy switches her off and it’s like, ah plot twist.",1,20,76
24,"She's a robot too. And then he like goes and sits down on the couch, and I think he like takes the bottle of wine with him and turns on the TV and starts watching sports.",1,7,36
25,"So it starts with like a shoe lying like kind of in the street. It’s a Velcro shoe, and after like a second or two, there’s text on the screen that says something like, “This is how the shoe got there.” And there's a song that starts playing, and I recognize the song, it’s like one of the theme songs from the movie Four Rooms.",1,15,65
26,"I don’t know if that was influential, but it’s like, it starts with this guy drinking a little carton of milk. And he's like leaning on a car, and he's watching the lady across the street, and some guy comes out, who obviously it’s his car, and shoos the guy who’s drinking the milk away from the car. And then the guy starts walking down the sidewalk looking over at the lady, and she's looking back at him. ",1,19,79
27,"And like at first they're kind of doing some like weird, they both stumble, and they sort of have a weird spastic move. And he like, while that’s going on, he puts his milk on a fence as he's walking. But then they start sort of, it becomes more clear that they're dancing, stumbling intentionally. It sort of goes with the music as it’s going along, and they're sort of playing along, and at one point, she goes behind, I don’t know what those things are called, they’re boxes sometimes in the street. I think they might have electrical equipment in it. Anyway, big metal box, so she disappears for a second but then comes out, and I think she has her hand like on her head, and it’s sort of like, I don’t know, mimicking some sort of dance from the 50s and he mimics her. And they're going and going and going, and then she's getting to the end of like the block. She sees this car sort of swerving behind the guy as he gets to, you know, across the street to the end of the block also, and it’s at an intersection. And of course like, she's like, “Oh my gosh,” like she puts her hands up to her face like, “Oh my gosh,” and like the guy walks out into the street and then gets hit by the car.",1,51,234
28,"And then like pretty funny but absurd, the car like goes over some lift and like flips over and like kind of like an action scene sort of thing. And then like you see the body flip into the air. I don’t think you see it land, but then like you see the shoe. And then like the camera sort of pans a little bit further down the block and there's another shoe, so maybe it’s implying that that happened another time.",1,19,82
29,"So it’s like a stick figure, and it starts off with like a voiceover saying, “This person will not be making it tonight,” I can't remember if it says “making it to dinner” or something, but like obviously something’s gonna happen to this guy. Anyway, so it’s driving up, it’s sort of panned out, car drives up to this tall building.",1,15,61
30,"And the voice, it’s a total narration from just this voiceover character describing what this guy’s doing, so he gets out of his car. He walks into the lobby, there's like two other stick figures that are like not doing it very well but trying to toss some trash into a waste-bin next to a desk with a sort of security guard check-in guy. The narration’s saying something like, “It’s this guy’s big day, you know, because he’s going to get a promotion.” Or at least that’s what he thinks he’s gonna get. And he walks into the elevator, and it’s describing like sort of internal feelings about the guy. And then it stops off at like I think the fourth floor and describes how there's a female coworker that he really likes, that he like makes coffee for and she never really, she doesn’t want him to make coffee for her. It’s not really clear at that point whether she like has any feeling for her, but he’s convinced that he's gonna get this promotion, and then she's gonna be attracted to him, because he's like right now only sort of an assistant partner or something. But he's gonna get promoted to something much more notable. Anyway, he gives her some coffee. She obviously doesn’t want it. She walks over to the window and pours it out onto like one of those guys who’s like maybe a window cleaner guy, um, it’s not scaffolding, but, you know, something.",1,68,249
31,"He falls over, and the camera pans a floor below or something to some other guy who like sees the person fall over. And at first isn’t sure if it’s a person or an object, looks out the window, yeah it’s a person, and then he calls the police. This is all said by the narrator, though.",1,14,57
32,"Alright, and then the guy walks to the elevator, takes the elevator up. And it’s like talking, the narrator starts talking about the handshake, and there's another guy that he passes, who’s like green. They're all, the stick figures have like solid colors. I forget what the main character was, maybe orange, and that guy looks like he just got good news. He may have seen, I think it may have cut to when he was just handshaking the boss. Anyway, so, so main character goes into the boss’ office, and I kind of forget the order of things, but like. The narrator’s like, “That was a weaker handshake than he was expecting,” and while basically the main character finds out that he's not getting the promotion,  the green guy who just got a promotion goes down to the floor with the female coworker who the orange guy is interested in, and she like starts making out with him. So anyway, the orange guy is like very distraught about this, and he thinks, “Oh, maybe I’ll go down and this lady will console me,” or maybe just talking to her will make him feel better, something like that. Anyway, he, he takes the elevator, elevator opens up, and he sees the two kissing, and he's like, like really shocked about that. ",1,65,223
33,"And there's some comment about how like that moment, it feels like the elevator doors are taking forever to close. Anyway, and then like there's a narration like, the orange guy’s like wondering what would happen if like, what it would feel like to be stuck in that inclined, small enclosed place with the green guy. And then of course then the green guy like walks towards the elevator, and he's like, “Hey, hold the elevator.” And they both get in. And they go back up a couple floors, and as the green guy is getting off, the narrator says, “Orange guy couldn’t believe what he said, like those three words that he’d never thought he’d say to anyone,” and he's probably like, “Fuck you buddy,” or something. Anyway, the orange guy, the green guy turns around and punches the orange guy in the face. Then the orange guy, who’s the main character, starts punching the green guy, and you see little splatters of blood on the elevator. Eventually, basically the green guy is killed by the end, the orange guy slams his briefcase on the green guy. So this is all in the elevator, and the orange guy’s like, “Uh oh,” or the narrator’s basically describing how the orange guy’s sort of freaking out about what he’s gonna do, ",1,51,221
34,"and so he decided to like drag him and take him home and then decide what to do with the body. So at this point I think maybe he starts to take the guy down the stairs, because he doesn’t want to take him down the elevator, because the security guard on the first floor will like obviously see this. He starts going down some the stairs, and then the camera pans down a couple floors to some lady, who needs to use the bathroom. And she really likes the bathroom on the eleventh floor because of the soap dispensers. And because of her New Year’s promise, she starts taking stairs, so she starts walking up the stairs. And right around the sixth floor they cross paths, and she faints and falls down the stairs and dies. And the orange guy like, this is all by the narrator, is like, the narrator says the orange guy feels bad about that, but really can’t blame himself.",1,35,165
35,"Anyway, so they're now like on the sixth floor, and the orange guy sees a conveniently placed ladder. And he takes the green guy over to that, and as that’s going on, the, the love interest of the green guy misses him, decides to take the elevator up to see him. Elevator opens up, and she, or, I don’t know if you even see her take the elevator, but you see her see them. The orange guy and green guy’s now near the window. And she sees this and faints, and the narrator’s like, oh yeah, and like the orange guy realizes that dead bodies make women faint or something like that.",1,29,112
36,"Anyway, so then orange guy tosses the green guy out of the window onto the ladder, and I think somehow swings himself out there at the same time. And so, but then he falls, or sort of falls a story or two while holding onto the ladder, and the ladder tilts away from the building. It’s all very precarious, and then at that point the narrator, like the narrator’s discussing how like, the orange guy’s having this deep insight that, you know,  he spent eight years here and like he's always trying to like make it, you know, get a better promotion and better salary or something. And now the orange guy realizes that’s just what everyone’s sort of doing, and like, you know, everyone wants that for themselves. The green guy, who’s dead now, wants it. He’s staring at some guy through the window, obviously that guy wants, wants, he's like the janitor guy or something mopping the floors, wants just something better for his life.  And then it cuts out there, like he doesn’t fall, but presumably that’s what eventually happens.",1,51,185
37,"What happens in The Rock, it’s a cartoon where it starts off with this like mountain, gray mountain, rock mountain with a face on it, and the guy’s like, the rock’s seeming pretty tranquil. There's a stream that’s running to it, and you see this weird crustacean thing. So it looks like it’s like very primitive Earth. The rock seems very peaceful and happy. So the rock closes its eyes, and then there's like some swirling that goes on, and then the guy, the rock sort of wakes up, and he’s like now covered in earth, so not that tall anymore, and the guy, so there’s some earth on top of him.",1,29,112
38,"So the rock closes its eyes, and then there's like some swirling that goes on, and then the guy, the rock sort of wakes up, and he’s like now covered in earth, so not that tall anymore, and the guy, so there’s some earth on top of him. And he, like grass and stuff, so he wakes up and he pops out of the ground. And he starts walking around, and he’s much smaller now, he's just like a big boulder. And there's like people in the background, looks like they're like farming or something. Anyway, so he's walking around, he walks up against, he walks and he sees this like sort of hill thing, other rock, and he like sort of gets comfy and like leans up against it to like take a nap. But the next thing he knows, somebody’s prying him off of that rock formation. And it’s like all these different people that are like not really farmers but definitely like several centuries old. And so they take it, take this rock, and you see it starts getting processed. And he's turned into like a little rock wheel, that’s part of like, I forget what those things are called.They're giant, wooden wheels that like take water and I think by the spinning of the water, I don’t know, they crush grain or something. So clearly it’s like, I don’t know, 1700s or something based on that technology, and you see like there are rocks outside with faces as well. Anyway, this thing’s going round and round and round.",1,70,262
39,"And then some soldiers walk in, and they kind of look like French outfits, but it like clearly like it gets crushed down, the rock gets crushed down into like a cannonball, and then you see it’s actually like the Revolutionary War. And yeah, so the rock gets fired out of a cannon and hits this other ship, the British ship. I think it’s a British ship, I mean if it’s the Revolutionary War it had to have been, but it had a flag that looked weird. Anyway, the ship sinks, the rock like goes down into the water, and I think the rock’s now a little bit fractured more. Basically throughout the whole time, like through the course of events, the rock keeps getting more and more fractured. Anyway, it’s in the water and it’s walking past another, another rock that has a face, and I forget what happens with the water. Somehow it gets out of the water.",1,44,160
40,"And it, it’s smaller again, and it's like it takes, it’s walking in a field, and it takes a nap on like a glove. And then next thing the rock knows, a guy has picked him up and flips him over and like the rock actually has a fossil on the back, and so the guy who picked him up is super happy and puts him in a little like tool cabinet thing.",1,16,73
41,"And now the rock is like on display in a museum with other rocks that are also fossils. And now the rock is like on display in a museum with other rocks that are also fossils. And you know, falls down or something, and then eventually falls out of like a taxidermy bear’s mouth or something, and then into a trash can of the janitor.",1,23,65
42,"Anyway, the janitor empties that out of like a window or something, and I think the rock falls onto the street. And then there's a guy with flowers looking really distraught who drops the flowers or throws them onto the street, and then picks up the rock and throws the rock through a window. And in the window there's like a couple having dinner, and so maybe this, that was the love interest of the guy who was very upset in the street. Anyway, I think the rock hits the male guy of the couple, who’s maybe stealing the distraught guy’s lady, in the head, I think, and then it bounces off the guy’s head and out the other window. And then it falls down onto the street or, I don’t know, it falls someplace.",1,30,135
43,"Eventually the rock makes its way to a landfill, I think. And now it’s like really fractured. And then there's like this crane, oh no, I know. It doesn’t get to a landfill first. It’s in like I don’t know, near the shore or a port or something, and there's other rock stuff, and a big crane picks it up, and eventually then it gets made into, I don’t know, it gets dropped off into another truck or something. So it’s not really a landfill I guess, and anyway, so with a whole other bunch of stuff, sand and rocks and stuff.",1,26,102
44,"And next thing you know, the thing is being processed and made into glass. And it’s glass that’s being put as the head of like some satellite that gets sent off into outer space.",1,8,34
45,"And it’s glass that’s being put as the head of like some satellite that gets sent off into outer space. So now you see shots of NASA and a space rocket going to outer space,  and now it’s this like satellite that zooms off, and it bounces off some sort of like meteor belt thing, and like the satellite gets damaged, and eventually it crashes on like another planet or the moon or something. And then like, you know, the rock’s like, kind of, now its glass is kind of broken, but then it, it just like totally plummets into this planet thing. And I think then swirls happen again, but basically like the planet changes like over time, and basically the rock becomes a mountain again, and there's like a stream or something, so it’s like the circle of rock life.",1,34,143
46,"Anyway, starts off where the guy is like in this small cute town, definitely European looking, talking to a lady. And the lady might be like sweeping stuff or something. And like he asks her where there's like a phone, and she's like, “Around the corner,” and he like goes around the corner.",1,15,53
47,"It’s a weird sort of mod dated sort of thing, but then he picks up a phone that’s like clearly from the 80s or something. Anyway, he speaks to an operator, and like the operator is like, needs him to like provide some sort of number of something, and he's like asking where he is or something, and the person’s like, “Can you give me your access number?” And he's like, “I don’t have one,” and the person’s like, “Well then I can't help you,” and he hangs up.",1,20,89
48,"And then he's like, clearly he doesn’t know where he is. He's like almost like he just woke up in this strange land. And so there's a like sort of digital board, it was weird, it sort of cut to that, I didn’t know what happened, but there's a digital board, and he presses some button, there's many buttons, sort of like typewriter buttons or something,  and he presses one and this like golf cart taxi thing pulls up. And there's this like Asian lady there. And then there's this Asian lady, and she has like eye makeup, very mod looking, so again like weird dated things. Anyway, so she picks him up, and she's like, “Where to?” and he's like, oh I think sort of like, “Take me to the nearest city,” or something, and she's like, “Oh I'm only local.” He's like, “Well then take me as far as you can,” and she's like, “Okay.” And she's like starts taking him and starts describing the area, and like I think when she first pulled up, she spoke French to him, and he's like, “Why’d you speak French to me?” and she's like, “It’s an international language.” And then she's like, starts talking about Poles and like other nationalities, and they like to visit here or something.",1,49,219
49,"And we were at the point where the guy was picked up in this taxi, and this lady was talking to him about Poles and some other nationality of people that maybe frequent the town or something, and she's like describing stuff and clearly, he's like not fully paying attention, and the camera keeps panning to her like it’s first person perspective of like the golf cart driving or something. And so you're getting to see the scenery and the town, and some people are walking around and everything. Anyway, so eventually, she's just talking to him, and eventually, he's not really saying much. They get to like as far as she's willing to go. And he gets out, and she's like, “That’ll be two credits.” He's like, “Credits?” like obviously doesn’t know what that is. And she's like, “Yeah whatever, I’ll, don’t worry about, you know, you'll pay next time,” and then she pulls away.",1,37,156
50,"And then he like walks up this storefront and reads the, there's like some sort of welcome sign or something, and then he walks in. And very, very subtly as he walks in, or maybe not so subtle, but the shopkeeper is talking to somebody else in another language. I don’t know, might’ve been German or something, or I sort of missed it, but it’s definitely not English. But as soon as the guy walks in, they stop talking in the other language and start talking in English.",1,16,88
51,"Okay, and then, the guy walks over to another part of the counter, the main guy, and the shopkeeper walks around, and the other guy, the other customer leaves. Okay, and then, the guy walks over to another part of the counter, the main guy, and the shopkeeper walks around, and the other guy, the other customer leaves. Okay, and then, the guy walks over to another part of the counter, the main guy, and the shopkeeper walks around, and the other guy, the other customer leaves. And the guy pulls out a black and white map and gives it to the guy and the guy looks at the map, and it’s like very small map. It’s not that big of a map, and it doesn’t cover a wide area. Basically it shows the village. I think it was called Your Village or something. And then there are these mountains surrounding it, and maybe there's a coastline at one point also. Anyway, the guy looks at it, and he's like, “No, I mean a much bigger map,” and he's like, “Alright, well all I have is in color then,” and the guy’s like, “Whatever, fine. Give me a map.” So he gives him the color map. It’s basically the same area of coverage, but just a much physically larger map. And the guy looks at it, and again the camera pans to like the mountains and the village itself on the map. And then the guy’s like, “No, I meant like a much larger area,” and the guy’s like, “Oh, sorry, all we have are the local maps, like nobody really cares about anything beyond that.” And then I think the guy’s like, “Whatever, that’s, you know, whatever,” and starts walking out, and a new customer walks in, and the shopkeeper’s like, “alright, well see you again.”  And then the guy walks out, and that’s the end of that short.",1,61,321
52,"And so that also started with a guy at a copy machine, and it was like very sort of green, blue filtered to set this mood of this guy working in a dingy office. So he's making photocopies, and out of the photocopier comes basically this big, black dot on a white paper. Anyway, he puts it to the side.",1,14,60
53,"He’s drinking like a disposable cup of, I don’t know, something, coffee. And he puts, he like drops it down, and it goes through the thing. And he puts, he like drops it down, and it goes through the thing. There's no speech in this. So he like reaches in and picks out his cup, and he’s like examining it for a while, like clearly sort of processing what this thing is doing.",1,20,73
54,"But then pretty quickly he just goes over to the vending machine, and puts it, puts the black dot up to the vending machine, reaches in, and gets a whole bunch of snacks. The snickers bar is one of the ones he starts eating. And when he puts his hand in, there's like a particular sound, like “whr whr whr” or something. Anyway, so the next thing, he looks over at this door, that’s like a Do Not Enter door.",1,18,80
55,"And he puts the paper on the door, and reaches in and unlocks the door. Behind the door is a security safe. So he like puts the paper on the security safe, and starts taking out money. And they're not dollars, they're like pounds or something, so like it’s a European film, short film. And he’s like taking out all the money, all the money. Eventually he's like reaching further into the back, and then he sort of starts to crawl in. And then he crawls in fully into it, but as he’s crawling in fully, the paper just had one piece of scotch tape that was holding it up, it falls under, it falls off. And the tape falls, the, the paper falls to the ground. And the tape falls, the, the paper falls to the ground.",1,36,138
56,"It starts off with like these two office coworkers, and they're making photocopies. And they like bend over at the same time to refill the paper into the tray, and then I think they look up over at each other, there's this sort of like cubicle divider thing, and then they quickly look down. It’s like this sort of flirty, you know, obviously they're attracted to each other. Anyway, there's a song going on through all of this, it’s not spoken. And it’s like weirdly sort of dated almost, like their outfits, it’s kind of like the 50s, but modern also.",1,30,101
57,"Anyway, while this is going on, like basically now, I think after the photocopying, it goes to the guy’s desk, and he opens a folder, and there’s like a smiley face in the folder made of post-its,  and he like looks at it for a little bit, and then he like sort of scoots back on his chair, so he's like outside of his cubby, and he's sees her outside of her cubby in the chair in a similar position just down the hallway. And then they quick, they both sort of scoot back in to their desks.",1,24,99
58,"And then the next thing is I think she’s like walking in, or maybe it’s the next day, and she raises the blinds, and it’s like a sun made out of the post-its. And then the next scene, he’s in the bathroom straightening his tie, and then like a guy goes into a bathroom stall, and closes it, and it’s like a post-it that’s like, like a, you know, a cartoon bubble where you’re thinking, and there’s a heart in the bubble.",1,20,82
59,"And then the next one is she goes into like the supply closet, and when she turns on the light, as her like, the way the camera’s posed with her hand like you know basically turned on the light string. It’s in a good position that like it matches on the wall there's like some flowers, so it’s like she's holding these flowers. The flowers are of course made out of post-its. Anyway, so she grabs a whole bunch of post-its. They're like, her hands are full of them, and she’s walking, you know, sneaking out of the supply closet walking down the hallway. And then she stops and she's looking, and then it like cuts across, and the guy has made this big mural of their two faces out of post-its. And you know, it’s kind of close up of his face, and he's like surprised, but then like the camera shows both of their faces, and they're smiling, and basically that’s the end of that.",1,40,167
60,"So it starts off, and there's this dude who’s like sweating and it’s like a hot day, he's listening to his tunes on his like Sony like headphones. He's got some double strawberry ice cream in his like plastic bag. And he just, he's waiting for the bus. And across the street, this like Ford Explorer sort of SUV car pulls up, and lady gets out of the door, and the car comes to like a sudden stop, so clearly something’s weird. Lady leaves the door open and goes to like a payphone or something. She seems already like she’s distraught. And she like tries the payphone, and it doesn’t work, and while that’s going on, the car just starts rolling a little bit.",1,32,124
61,"And then she like sees the guy, and she walks over to him. And by the time she gets to him, the car stopped, it didn’t roll that far, but a little bit. And the guy is just observing this, and the guy is like also just seems like a weirdo, like weird sort of like face, sort of like a Napoleon Dynamite gaze going on, like, and so she asks him for his phone. And she's like, “I'm not going to steal it,” and he's like, “Okay,” and gives it to her. And she walks to the other side of the street and calls some guy, and like clearly she's upset at the guy, and she's like, “I'm going to go to the cops, like, you know, where are you? I'm here now. You said you were gonna be here.” Anyway, maybe he hangs up on her or something, because she is pissed, and she slams the phone on the ground. And the guy is just watching this and like he doesn’t have a huge affective response, although he's clearly kind of like, “What the fuck? My phone just got smashed.”",1,42,192
62,"So he walks over and like picks up the phone, and he's like, “Hey, so like can I get like sixty dollars for my phone so I can get a new one?” and she's like not really paying attention to him. She's like pretty upset, ",1,9,46
63,"and then the, it cuts to like this guy driving up in sort of an old school, but well kept car, like a Caddy or Chevrolet, sort of boxy car with some, some, I forget if it’s classical or some weird gospel thing music going on on the radio. And it like pauses there for a little bit, and you can see her staring at him, and he's like staring at the two of them. And I think it cuts to she's like, “There he is.”  And he's like under some sort of overpass thing, and that’s where the car’s parked, and he hasn’t gotten out of the car yet. And she's like that's him.",1,28,116
64,"And then I think she starts yelling at him or something and walks towards the car and the guy gets out of the car. And she's like yelling at him, and he's like, “It’s gonna be okay, you know, just like, you gotta trust me,” or something. And at that point maybe she's like, “Do you know who this guy is?” or something, and I can't remember if at that point he does the sort of magic act and pulls out the gun at that point, or if like right before then the sort of slackjawed guy in the headphones, who’s now taken off the headphones and they're just resting on his neck, but you can still hear the music faintly.  And he's like, “Oh yeah you're like the magician guy from, I don’t know, you do the magic,” anyway, and he's like, “Oh yeah, you're his assistant.”",1,29,149
65,"And then she draws a gun on him. And at that point maybe she's like, “Do you know who this guy is?” or something, and I can't remember if at that point he does the sort of magic act and pulls out the gun at that point, Anyway, at that point or like shortly before, the guy has done the magic with the handkerchief to reveal this very small sort of gun. It’s like the sort of gun that in the Wild West women would have strapped to their garter belts, or at least that’s how it gets depicted in films. Anyway, so he has a little small gun like that, like a one-shot gun or something. And he starts describing, and she's just like, “Where is she?” or something and like yells at him or something. But then she like shoots a shot like up in the air, and then you can hear whimpering or something.",1,35,157
66,"And it’s clearly coming from the back trunk of the car.  And she like goes over to that, and while that’s happening, the magician starts talking to like the other dude, who now like, you can look at his face, he's just drenched in sweat. Anyway, and while the lady’s trying to get the trunk open, the magician guy is like talking to the, to the, to the other guy, and he pulls out another handkerchief, and he's like, “Do you see this?” and like pulls it open, and it’s like this mini coffin, and he opens the coffin. There's like a skeleton in a fetal position of like a bird or something. Very tiny, and then the guy starts saying something, like it’s kind of like, gospel like preachery thing, but like kind of like a spell. And then the like kid guy is like clearly in this weird daze or something. And then like the guy just like falls over.",1,40,163
67,"And the magician is sort of just like, “Oh,” almost like he’s messed up the spell or something, and then he opens up some paper, like reciting something, almost like he's trying to figure out what he said wrong or something. So maybe he's trying to put the guy into a spell, but he did the wrong spell, almost like he's not a very good magician. Anyway, by this time, the lady opens the trunk, and like you don’t see what’s in the trunk, and the lady sort of had this gasp thing like, “Oh my god,”  and then she walks over to the guy, and the guy’s like, I forget if he says something like, “It’s gonna be okay,” or if she just shoots him outright.And he falls to the ground, and you see him like take one shot and kills her.So now they're both dead.And this guy, this dude and his ice cream that's just everywhere, and that shot of him falling over with the ice cream, and it’s like dripping out of the bag, it was very humorous. And so now he's sort of in a fetal position over, but he's not dead. He sort of leans over and I think at this point you might start hearing barking or something. He sort of leans over and I think at this point you might start hearing barking or something.",1,51,233
68,"Anyway, this guy’s sort of like leans over, the guy who sort of like passed out, and he starts barking. And he's like acting like a dog and starts licking the ice cream and goes over and sniffs the guy, so you're like all right, so this guy got put under some spell that he thinks he’s a dog.And then obviously the camera pans over, and sure enough, it’s a woman who is barking like a dog.So maybe that was the daughter, or you know, some person of meaning to the assistant, who is now shot dead.So they start barking at each other, and of course they do the gratuitous smell each other’s butts.And they're barking and barking, and they start walking together, and the guy like leans over and goes on all fours, and they're kind of like aggressively barking, feeling each other out sort of thing.But eventually they start walk, you know, on all fours walking down the street barking with each other, and then it ends sort of like that.",1,39,173
