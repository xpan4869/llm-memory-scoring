And then she sort of backtracks in the record and realizes that the record is sort of ticking away along with her life, and so it's kind of like going forward in time with the pizza being eaten.

29,"It starts with the words, I think ""Keith Reynolds can't come home tonight,"" something like that and it's basically just describing a day for Keith Reynolds.",1,6,26
30,"So Keith Reynolds is this like, is this like businessman-type guy. He walks into the office, and then describes how he's been in love with this girl on the fourth floor, and he's expecting, oh, just to backtrack a little; it's I think like the beginning of his eighth year here, so he's been the longest tenured junior member of the business, um so he's really expecting a promotion. So when he goes up to the fourth floor and sees this girl that he's in love with, he is sort of musing of how if he gets a promotion, he may get the girl to fall in love with him. And he pours her a coffee from the free coffee machine and he gives it to her and it says that she always really, it says that he always does that or routinely does that, but she actually doesn't like coffee. And then she pours the coffee out, it accidentally hits this guy who's doing the windows, and it looks like he falls a long way from the fourth floor, but doesn't really discover what happens to him.",1,42,188
31,,0,,0
32,"And then he goes up to the eighth floor to meet his boss, where this guy Patrick Campbell had just been meeting with the boss, and he sees that he's going to get his promotion, but it turns out he does not, the boss has given it to someone else and that someone else happened to be Patrick Campbell who was now going down to the fourth floor to meet Keith's love interest. And they are actually in love and they are kissing and Keith comes down the elevator all dejected to the 4th floor and then sees them kissing, then just gets, sort of watches it, she kicks her leg up, .",1,29,113
33,"and it says that the elevator was open for an inordinately long time, and then it kinda closes, oh no so it doesn't close, and then Patrick Campbell asks him to hold the elevator and then blows her a kiss as he's coming in They go up a few floors and then as Patrick is leaving the elevator, she says to him, or uh Keith says to Patrick three words which are probably ""go fuck yourself"" and then he turns around and they get into a fight and then Patrick Campbell punches him, and then Keith punches him and kills him, and then he realizes that there's, um, that he has to do something with the body, and he tries to not get caught.",1,32,124
34,"It says in the movie he tries not to get caught because people don't like murderers; it's probably a fair enough statement. But as he's going, as he's going, he decides to bring him down the steps because he realizes how easily it could for him to get caught in the elevator, although I don't really understand that logic. And as he's taking him down the steps this woman from the 1st or 2nd floor is walking up the steps, and because she decided to take the steps because of some sort of exercise reason, and she runs into him, and faints, and falls down a few stairs and it looks like she might have died as well, and he drags Patrick beyond her and then he realizes that once he gets to, I think it's the sixth floor or something,",1,37,141
35,"that he's going to take the ladder but then his love interest comes up and she sees Patrick's dead body being lugged almost onto the elevator, he almost runs in the elevator, sorry ladder, without seeing her, but she saw it and she fainted as well, but thankfully did not die, she did not fall down any stairs.",1,14,58
36,"And then he starts to take him down the elevator and then, sorry, I keep saying elevator, I mean ladder, down the ladder,  and then he sort of has this moment of epiphany that everyone wants the same thing: it's like promotion and a happy life, a good romantic life and all that stuff. And then it shoots to like this guy who's cleaning a floor below, and it looks like he has hung himself, and the guy seems him, and that's the end of that clip.",1,26,88
37,"So the rock starts as just like a pair of eyes and nose on top of a, as like a whole mountain. In like prehistoric times, you like see a little prehistoric fish come up and like look at it and like go back. It's actually not really a fish, more like a salamander, an amphibious thing. And then he, and then you see, there's like sort of a jumping around in time, where we see him like change forms, you know the mountain like becomes under water or whatever, gets ground down to like the size of like a boulder.",1,25,101
38,"And then there's like a tree on top of the boulder, and then there's like this grass, so like maybe closer to I don't know, maybe more modern times and then yeah it is modern times because someone is cutting down a branch of the tree with a saw, an electric saw. And then that falls on him and then he sort of grows legs of some sort, he is able to walk around and walk away, but then gets caught, and then, how does he get caught, I don't remember. He eventually becomes like a wheel, a wheel that's used in machinery to like churn things out, and then sort of gets ground down from there.",1,33,117
39,,0,,0
40,"At some point it becomes like, about the size of a foot and is found by a paleontologist. It looks like it has a, some sort of trilobite fossil on the bottom of it, so the paleontologist is all excited, picks it up, and puts it in a little box.",1,16,50
41,"And then he's on display for a while, and then he grounds down smaller.",1,4,14
42,"It's in some sort of city setting and gets thrown through the window where there's couples having dinner and then comes out the other side, and then gets ground down further.  um, yeah, he's like sort of run over by this like, by a steam roller, and then he becomes very small, gets picked up, and um,",1,20,58
43,"it's eventually deposited near a beach, and then is picked up by like a big lift that is depositing minerals to be some sort of refinery.",1,8,26
44,"And then it's like molten stuff, and then eventually goes back to being a mountain again.",1,4,16
45,"And then it's like molten stuff, and then eventually goes back to being a mountain again.",1,4,16
46,"where this guy was in this town, he was trying to make a call, he seemed to be lost. And the woman that he's talking to in this sort of restaurant-type area points him in the direction of a phone.",1,8,40
47,"He picks up a phone; it's not really a phone booth, it's just like a stray big phone, like they would have in the mobile phones in the, not quite mobile, but like the phones you could carry around in your house that are kind of clunky and big. Picks up and tries to make a call, but the operator requires a number from him, like to reach him at. he says he didn't know the number so he couldn't make the call.",1,19,83
48,"Someone drives by, and he jumps in and says, and he asks, it's a woman, an Asian woman on a golf cart, and she, he basically asks to take him as far away as possible. It is a golf cart or a real car? I don't remember. Take him as far away as she could. And so she just doesn't take him that far, it's like basically within the same town.",1,14,71
49,"And she, and they have a short conversation about the town and how it's very cosmopolitan; and she speaks, she mentions something in French and he says they're also Poles and Czechs there.",1,7,33

51,"He gets out of the car and then he goes into like a shop with a map, and he asks for a map, and all that the maps has on it is like the stuff within the town, and it's got like mountains but it's basically just the town itself. So he asks for a bigger map, and of course he's given a map in color this time, and it opens up and it's like bigger but it's actually just  a more detailed map of the same area. And he asks for a map of, that has a wider area and it didn't seem like there were able to oblige him in that.",1,29,114

61,"Okay so this clip starts with this woman who has pulled over, and is trying to use the phone, and the phone's not working and so she comes over and sees this guy listening to his headphones and asks if she can use his phone. And the lady's kind of wearing something bizarre, it's like-it's not like a kimono but there's something that-uh, like a weird sheet around her. And the guy allows her to use the phone; she guarantees him that she's not going to steal the phone.She tries to make a call to I think the police or someone, she's clearly in distress, and she is angered by what happens on the phone and throws down the phone and breaks it.",1,34,123
62,"And then guy is like ""hey um, you just broke my phone; can I like have 60 bucks or something.""",1,4,20
63,"And she refuses because her, someone that she knows, apparently her partner, magician partner, drives under this nearby like over house, and so she walks towards him and the guy whose phone was broken follows her because he still wants money and she keeps ignoring him.",1,16,46
64,"Then they approach the guy, the guy's car, and the guy asks who he is--No, first she asks where SHE is, some unknown girl, at least to this point, and then he sort of I think brushes that off and then asks who the guy is and needs to explain that his phone was blah blah blah blah blah. And, oh, before that I think the magician asks like ""oh do you know who I am"" and he says no. But then he realizes that he recognizes him as a guy who does a magic show and that the girl is a partner.",1,23,103
65,"And then at some point she aims a gun at the magician. And then they're both aiming guns at each other, oh no, sorry, she's aiming a black gun at him, and he's sort of conjures up a gun, some sort of magic trick, as if he had one up his sleeve.",1,10,52
66,"They're pointing at each other and then she kind of starts off towards the back of the car as the guy, as the magician guy starts like putting a spell on the guy whose phone was broken. And there's this long sort of montage of like this strawberry being like spilled and the guy whose phone was broken keeps like getting further and further into being uh, into hallucinating.Um, um, and then he falls over.",1,25,75
67,"And then the woman finds, goes into the back of the car and opens it up and then gets very angry, and comes back and shoots the magician, and the magician as he's falling down shoots her and then we see the guy whose phone was broken eating or like licking up the rest of like a full tub of ice cream, presumably strawberry, or double strawberry ",1,19,68
68,"and then we realize that he's been sort of turned into a dog, not physically, but he seems to be acting like a dog and he's like barking and like moving around on all fours. And then he moves back towards the car and we realize that presumably the girl that they were looking for was probably in the trunk and then she is out, she is also a dog, and they are barking at each other and sort of sniffing each other and then they are playing sort of, possibly doggy love of some sort, but uh, a little bit tough to tell.",1,29,104
