And he always offers her coffee, but she never wants it, uh and then he goes up, to actually talk to his boss, but there's somebody else there.",1,24,87
31,"Well beforehand, before the whole thing started, something had fallen off the window. I think at the beginning and they called an ambulance.",1,5,23
32,"And he always offers her coffee, but she never wants it, uh and then he goes up, to actually talk to his boss, but there's somebody else there. I forgot his name - I think Patrick - Patrick's already there and they're shaking hands, and he leaves and then so he goes in to talk to his boss. But he says the handshake, well he doesn't say it - there's a narrator the whole time - but the narrator says that the handshake is like, was not as strong as he thought it would be. And then, he didn't get the promotion he wanted to, actually the promotion was given to Patrick. Meanwhile Patrick goes to the floor where Sarah is - the dream girl - the Reynolds', Keith Reynolds' dream girl. And he tells her about the promotion and then they're very happy, hugging and kissing. And so then Keith leaves very sad, and he goes down the elevator to the floor where Sarah is, sees them together.",1,42,169
33,"And it says that the door, elevator door, was open longer than usual. And so, then Patrick comes in. And then they go up some floors and then Patrick comes, was gonna come out, but then Keith said some bad words, I guess some three-letter words, he didn't want to say. And then Patrick gets upset, and punches him in the face. So then Keith gets upset and starts hitting him and then ends up killing him.",1,24,77
34,"And so he has to now dispose of the body to get home, I guess. And then he takes it out of the elevator and is going to down the stairs with it.

36,"So then he throws the body off of the, out the window, um, somebody sees the body that fell out the window, so, um. But back to the part where I was at, um, so he's on the ladder and starts thinking about his life choices, and he starts thinking about how everybody wants to get a better job, and everybody wants the dream girl, and so maybe the decisions he made weren't the best decisions.",1,20,76
37,"And then, so it starts off this big, mountain-size rock is - the cutest nose - is like staring at, I guess, the water, and there's like life, living creatures in the water, and they're happy but then the rock lives many years so he sees time pass by. He goes from the dinosaurs, and then it's, I guess, the ice age, and then it's just like modern times and it's like greenery.

40,"He's trying to find some sleep. Um, but then he gets grabbed- somebody takes him, he gets taken,  I think because he had a, he becomes like a small rock, but he has a fossil behind him so, like an archeologist, I guess, finds him, takes him, and then puts him in a museum.",1,16,55

46,"So then the guy, he's really confused about where he is. So he tells the lady at the restaurant. She had like a maid outfit. She told, he asked her, where he is, and where the police is, and she doesn't really give him the answer he's looking for. So he walks away.",1,13,53
47,"He goes over to where the telephone is and he tries to make a phone call. But the lady asked him for a unit number. And, well first he asks which register it is, and she asked for unit number, and he says, ""no, I don't have a unit number.” So she says there's no phone call then.",1,14,58

So he asked her to drive her the farthest away into town that - into the town that they are.",1,19,77
49,"He's surprised like she's spoken French, so they had a conversation about that. And she, and so then she drives him to like this store, and then she tells him it's 2 units.

50,"So then he walks into the store, and then he goes over to the counter.",1,3,15
51,"He asks the clerk, um for a map, and then um, he asks, ""a colored or a black and white?” And the guy says, ""Oh, doesn't matter, just give me a map.” And so the guy like goes over, is thinking about it, grabs this, like pamphlet-map-thing, and gives it to him. It's the black and white one. He opens it, but it's like a very plain map. It just says the mountains. The mountains. Your village. So it's like, there's like no names. And so he asks, ""Oh, can I see, like, a bigger map with like, you can see more?” And so, he gives him the colored map, which is basically the same thing but in color. So he like is, like confused and upset. But then he like, somebody comes in and the clerk starts attending him. And he tells him, he did the same sign as the Asian girl, with the ha- with the circle, on her eye, and see you later kind of thing. So then he goes out, and I think that was that for that one.",1,48,183
52,"And then there's the one about the black hole, where um he was making copy, trying to make copies, but the copy machine wasn't really working with him.

55,"And so then he gets a better idea about going to, I guess, grab the money from the company. So he goes over, meanwhile nobody's there, so it's like after hours. He started the day off wanting to leave. So then he goes over to the door, and puts the paper there and sticks his hand through the black hole, opens the door, goes in to the vaults, and then he places, he tapes a paper to the vault. And starts putting his hand in and taking out all the money out of the vault. But then he gets really greedy so then he goes to grab more and ends up putting his whole body inside of the vault.
