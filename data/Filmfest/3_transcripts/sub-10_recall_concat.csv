1,"The first skit, uh, the first story, was called Catch Me If You Can, and it opens on the stage of a game show that looks like it's set in the 1970s. And I think the show was called So you tell a lie? And it's um shown on this kind of like billboard logo kind of Las Vegas style. And it starts with a voiceover, a host is saying something about how um we're going to bring on stage one of the greatest impersonators through history. And um that this guy had flown for, wait so before that, these three guys in airline pilot suits come out and they each introduce themselves as Frank something, I think it's Frank Anglesall. And um the camera pans from each one to another as the voiceover says um this guy had impersonated a pilot for PanAm and flown like 300 miles or like 3000 miles for free. And he did this at the same time as pretending to be a doctor at some like at like Mass General Hospital, um and that he had done all of this before the age of 19. Oh before he says that he did this before the age of 19, he says he also stole like several million dollars and forged bills and checks.",1,70,218
2,"And so then it goes to this old lady who asks some questions. And she asks number one, um, the first impersonator number one, like, uh why did you do this `cause you're so smart, how did obviously, why did you put all this effort into impersonating people when you could just actually do something and become a doctor for real? And the first pilot guy says that it was really a um, a calculated thing, which was that it was just uh dollars and cents, he used that phrase, and he thought that it was just the way he could make the most money with the least effort. And then the lady asks the second impersonator who is acted by Leonardo di Caprio and she asked him, how did you get caught? And he says he got caught by a um, this detective, I forget his name, Carl, I think.",1,43,151
3,"And as he's, at the moment he says that, it flashes back to this um guy Carl who's this big old guy wearing a hat and a big trenchcoat. And he's talking to a bunch of French police officers who were carrying umbrellas and he was telling them that he's like the American detective or the American police officer. And he demands to see Frank the prisoner.",1,19,67
4,"Um and eventually they take him down this into this like nasty prison, in uh Marseilles, I think on the screen it says Marseilles, 1947 or something like that. And so then he arrives at this prison door and um the prison guard tells him uh you won't open this door, don't open this door, and he opens this little slot and he says, don't pass him anything through here. You can sit here and talk to him but don't pass him anything through this grill.",1,23,86
5,"So then he sits down and he looks inside through this grill, it looks like a shot of like this cell looking out at him and he tells the prisoner that he's been sent there by the U.S. Consulate or something to read him his rights under like extradition treaty. He starts on Article 1, it's really boring, I don't remember what he says, but the prisoner inside, Frank, is coughing really hard and he's like wrapped up in these blankets and he's really dirty and has lots of like really long hair and like...and stuff. And he's coughing and coughing and coughing and he says help me, help me, and um the police officer is like no don't do this to me, you know I can't, or whatever. So then he says like stay with me, he starts with Article 2 and then the prisoner um starts coughing and then he collapses and it looks like he's dead or like in a coma. And so the police officer gets really worried and he stands up and starts shouting, like Frank! Frank! And then like shouts to the police officers that he needs a doctor, he needs a doctor.",1,42,199
6,"And so they come and take him out and they bring him to the medical bay and um they wrestle him onto the bed where he looks like he's dying. He's coughing and the police officer's like listen to me Frank, I'm gonna get you out of here, tomorrow we're going home, tomorrow we're going home, and then the chief of the prison and the guards are then washing their hands and he's like what's he doing, and the police officers said they're washing their hands so we don't get lice  and uh the police officer says he needs to see a doctor if he's coming back to America tomorrow, and the guy says um, the person says listen, um, the doctor's not coming until tomorrow, and so the police officer says ah this guy is coming back to America and he needs to see a doctor, if he dies it's on your head. And then the prison ward then turns around, and the door is swinging, and they open the curtains, surrounding the bed, and it's empty.",1,44,179
7,"And then it flashes to this long hallway in the prison full of cells, it's two stories and all the prisoners are shouting um because the prisoner Frank is running down it trying to escape. But then he collapses and he just has to crawl. And as he's crawling away, you can see the ward and the prison guards and the policeman going after him. And eventually the ward catches up with him and he pulls out a gun, and he sticks it against Frank's head. And so Frank like sits back on his knee and he raises his hands and says okay Carl, the police officer, take me home. And then he collapses backwards on his back like spreadeagle and then the clip ends.",1,29,125
8,"And it's a cartoon and there's this woman with like bright orange hair who's sitting on an armchair at a fuzzy old house. Um and a package arrives at the door, so she goes and gets it, she opens it up and it's a record and the record is called um the single life.",1,15,54
9,"And so she puts it into her record player and she sits down with a slice of pizza. But then as it's playing, slowly the slice of pizza is like...it all disappears except for the crust. And she's really confused and then she looks down at the record and spins it backwards. The pizza reappears. She scoots it forward, the pizza disappears again. She does it several times and then she fast-forwards way ahead, or like a bit more. And the pizza disappears and the red candle sitting on her bedside like burns all the way down. And then she goes back and forth between that a couple times.",1,23,109
10,"And then she's like uh she spins it really far, a lot, and then she's in a new house and it looks like kind of an upscale house. And she's wearing like a fancy black dress and it looks like really well to-do, and she looks down at herself and it turns out she's pregnant. And she's like really happy and there's a picture of her like getting married on the mantelpiece. So then she gets a like, she has an expression on her face like she suddenly gets an idea, and she spins the record a whole bunch, like around around around really fast, and then suddenly she's not pregnant anymore, and there's a kid. ",1,25,117
11,,0,,0
12,"Um and then I don't remember exactly what happens to the kid, like the kid is annoyed with something, and so she spins the record way further and then uh suddenly she's old and in a wheelchair. And um she tries to spin it forward but I guess her hands are shaking, so as she wheels forward and tries to spin it, it keeps resetting her to the beginning where she is just sitting there, so that happens over and over and over, until she gets a really determined look on her face, and she spins it, ",1,24,98
13,"and then suddenly she's like an old lady and she's no longer in a wheelchair, but she has a walker. And she's kind of confused about this and so she goes forward to the record player to move it again, but as she walks forward, she trips and falls. And then um while she's lying on the ground, the record ends and um she dies and becomes a um ashes and then the needle on the record gets set on the side of the record player and it ends.",1,24,89
14,"And then another clip was called like the Boyfriends and then it flipped to a screen that said High maintenance. And it opens on this um pretty fancy dining room and there's a long table with a white tablecloth, and three candles on it. And at one end, there's this woman, this white woman with short, dark hair, and at the other end is this white guy with dark hair. And they're eating dinner in silence, and it's kind of awkward. Um it seems sort of stilted. And the woman asks him, uh, would you like some wine? Um he says no, or no no no sorry, she gets up to pour wine into his glass, but he covers it with his glass and he says ""you know I can't drink when I'm on call,"" ",1,38,136
15,"Um he says no, or no no no sorry, she gets up to pour wine into his glass, but he covers it with his glass and he says ""you know I can't drink when I'm on call,"" and the woman kind of like rolls her eyes and she goes back to her seat and pours herself a giant glass of wine and then drinks the entire thing in one gulp and then refills it. the guy says something like ""the asparagus is particularly tender today, honey,"" and uh the woman says, ""some people say that asparagus is an aphrodisiac,"" and the guy's really stilted and he's wearing like a suit and he says ""who says that?” And the woman's like, oh you know just some people, you know, like people. Um, and then it's really awkward and she suddenly, something happens, which I can't quite remember, and then she suddenly says like ""this isn't what I expected for our anniversary. Today's our anniversary.”",1,40,163
16,"something happens and she throws the glass of water, the glass of wine, into his face. oh, right, I forgot this part. Earlier, she gets mad at him, and she's like you're just a computer system analyst, not a surgeon! You don't need to not drink when you're on call.",1,12,50
17,"Um and she starts shouting about how it's her anniversary and this isn't how she imagined her anniversary, silently eating dinner, and some awkward conversation, and then if she's lucky, followed by some really mechanical sex, um which she hates. And then the guy sits up, and he's covered in wine, and he takes out a cigarette and starts smoking, and she says like ""not in my house, you don't start smoking,"" and she takes it and then stubs it out in an ashtray on the other side of the table, but he just takes out another cigarette.",1,24,98
18,"Um, and then I'm not sure what happens, but she eventually approaches him, and she's like, ""oh I didn't mean that.” It sounded really sarcastic, but then she's sitting on his lap and she's like caressing him and being like ""you know I didn't mean what I said, I was just really angry,"" ",1,11,54
19,"and her hand reaches behind his head, so like his head lowers down his collar, where there's like this little like switch thing. And she switches it off and then the guy basically powers down, and it turns out he's a robot. And then she's just sitting there sighing. She goes back to the other side of the table, takes off her shoes, and sticks her feet on the table.",1,17,70
20,"Um so then she's on her laptop on her bed, and she's looking at the website of the manufacturer who makes these like companion robots, these love robots, and I forgot what it was called, it had a clever name, it's like love something or the other and the logo is like this red heart on a white background. She's looking through different profiles, and she eventually comes across one that's called Paul, which is this like rugged uh like dangerous type guy with like kind of long, shaggy hair. Um and she's looking at this guy and comparing it to her like shut-off robot which is really like staid and boring. So she takes up this Bluetooth uh phone, she sticks it in her ear and she calls the company, and they ask like what can I do for you? And she says, um, she sounds kind of nervous, and she says like, ""I'm really disappointed with my companion, my companion product,"" and they're like ""oh so what kind do you have?"" and she says she has like the 100 model, and then they ask what her complaint is, and she says that he has no ambition, no spontaneity, and the customer service person just says oh that's a really common complaint about the 100 model, would it help if we upgraded you to a superior model? And she says yes and the person on the phone says okay, well did you have one in mind? Um and she reads out the like serial number of Paul, the rugged guy, and she's looking around pictures, and she's like oh, if he could be a rockclimber, and she clicks again and it's a guy massaging a woman, and she's like oh no a masseuse, a massage companion, a massage robot. And then the camera pans around so it's now facing her instead of the screen, and it's like her on the edge of the bathroom and it's like her, it's her in a bedroom on a laptop and she's no longer nervous, she's excited, she's like, oh wait! How about a rock climber masseuse? And then she's talking about specification, she's like well, could the hair be shorter? And I like blonde and no facial hair? Well maybe just like a 5 o'clock shadow, uh so basically she's designing her perfect boyfriend. There's also, so while she's ordering this, she looks at the robot, and then looks at this picture of her in like a wedding dress when she's like married but then she just keeps ordering.",1,106,427
21,"And then um there's a ring at the door, uh, the doorbell rings at her door, she opens it, and there's this tall beautiful blonde woman with a giant box, wooden box, and there's another identical woman there also, and they bring um the guy, the box in, and they open it up and there's a guy, he's like plastic wrapped, and it's this blonde rugged guy with a 5 o'clock shadow. And they unpack him, put him on the couch.  And then they take the old, boring guy,  Um so anyways they take this guy and they um put him on a dolly and he's strapped down, and then they're wheeling him away, and the lady suddenly looks kind of sad, and she's like wait! And she runs up to him on the dolly, and she kisses him, and then she takes away his wedding ring. She lets them take it away. And then she puts the wedding ring on the new guy. Oh and the new guy actually at the dinner table, not on the couch. And she switches him on, sits down at the other end of the table, and it's just like the dinner from the night before. With the candles, the tablecloth, and everything.",1,52,211
22,"And the guy robot actually comes alive, um, and he starts eating, and the woman asks, offers wine, she says, oh would you like some wine? And he says no, I can't drink, I have a climb tomorrow. And she's really disappointed, she's like oh no, it's the whole same thing again, especially because the next thing he says is the asparagus is really tender, and he says, and she's like oh, she's like really resigned, oh is it, blah blah blah, and the guy says um oh you know some people say that asparagus is an aphrodisiac and she perks up and she says kind of like flirtingly kind of like flirting, who says that, and he says oh, just people.",1,29,122
23,"He puts like his napkin down, and he walks around to the other side of the table, who starts massaging the table, sorry, her elbow, her shoulders, he asks like, how was your day, dear. And she's not very interesting either. She talks just about how like she went to town, she went shopping, and then uh went to dinner, or lunch with Anna, and that it's her anniversary, she decided to treat herself, and then um, as the guy's massaging her, he approaches her neck and it turns out there's a switch on her neck also, so she's actually a robot too!",1,27,103
24,"And he switches her off, which she just slumps over, and he grabs like a bottle of beer, and turns on sports on the TV and sits down and is drinking beer, and that's the end of it.",1,6,38
25,"And it starts with this guy, it starts with a shot of these worn-out shoes, and then it pans up to this uh milk carton, um, and he opens it like first opens it, and there's something like buying this milk and then he opens it and drinks it.",1,14,49
26,"And it starts with this guy, it starts with a shot of these worn-out shoes, and then it pans up to this uh milk carton, um, and he opens it like first opens it, and there's something like buying this milk and then he opens it and drinks it. And he's drinking it and he's leaning against a car and then the owner of the car comes out and he shouts at him so he um gets off the car and he's walking away, and he trips on like an uneven path of the sidewalk.",1,28,95
27,"And then, as he trips, he sees a woman across the street also trip, it looks like she's tripping at nothing. And so he's sipping his milk and like looking at her, and then uh let's see, he puts the milk up on the edge of a fence. And the woman across the street, even though she doesn't have any milk also reaches up, and can see it. Um and so then he starts walking like exaggeratingly funny, like swinging arms and bent over, and she copies him and then she disappears behind like a mailbox and she's now like really bent over, crazy, walking crazy. He imitates her. And they're imitating back and forth, and um, he's reaching the end of the street um towards the crosswalk but he's turned looking at her across the street. And she tries to signal to him, stop, stop, stop, there's a car coming, don't enter the street and she's like waving her arms, but he doesn't understand and he's just copying her and he keeps walking forward.",1,42,175
28,"And then he gets hit by a car. And presumably he dies. And um one of the shoes like flies off, it lands in the gutter. And then the screen pans forward, we see another shoe, except it's like covered in bees or something.   ",1,11,47
29,,0,,0
30,"and he enters this office building and there's a voiceover describing everything and said that this is a really, really important day for Ryan Reinholtz because he's been there for 8 days. and this is the day that he's going to become a, uh, he's going to be promoted, because he's the most senior junior businessman. Um so he enters the elevator, he goes up a floor to see this lady named Sarah that he has a crush on. And he's imagining like this future with him with this special woman, who is a pink stick figure and what he does so like flirt with her but not very well, he just makes her a cup of coffee. So he makes her a cup of coffee and gives it to her and he leaves to the elevator, but Sarah doesn't actually like coffee, and so she pours it out the window. On the window there's a guy on a ladder, um who's like maybe washing windows or something, and so she dumps the hot coffee on him and he falls down.",1,48,181
31,"And he falls down past this window of this HR guy. And this HR guy is like what? There's something or someone who fell down outside the window, and so he goes out to check, and he looks down and he figures out it was a someone who fell down, and so then he calls 911.",1,11,56
32,"And then um meanwhile Ryan Reynolds is going up to the uh 7th floor and he's imagining what it's like to get his promotion, and like how there'll be this really firm handshake, and they'll give him this gold... pen to sign his name, to make him partner, and he'll look happy and everything. Um and in the meantime um this other guy is coming down, um to see Sarah, um, to give her some good news he's got today and meanwhile back in the 7th floor with the bosses, the handshake is a little less firm than he expected, and there's no gold pen, then he gets told by the um two senior guys that someone else was promoted and he wouldn't be promoted. And so meanwhile the other guy I think his name is Carl, is telling Sarah that he's been promoted, and they're like hugging and kissing and he's really excited that she's really happy for him, and you know Ryan's all like oh I'm sad, so he goes down the elevator, and he thinks oh maybe Sarah wants another cup of coffee.",1,51,186
33,"But then when the elevator doors open, he sees um Carl and Sarah kissing, kissing with open mouths, and Ryan is like oh no, this elevator door seems to be open for a really long time, it's awkward. And then Carl says oh can you hold the elevator for me, oh! And he enters the elevator. But before that actually, while Ryan is watching Carl and Sarah make out, he's picturing in his head what he'd like to do to Carl if he were in a small enclosed room with him. So then conveniently Carl's in the elevator with him and Ryan gets upset and he says a three letter phrase to him, that he's never said before to anyone,  and then he immediately regrets doing that because um Carl punches him in the face, and then Ryan overreacts, and he starts like beating him, and then Ryan's on the floor, on the ground, and he takes, Carl takes the briefcase, I'm sorry, Ryan takes the briefcase, and he smashes his head open. And then Ryan's like, oh no I've killed him, what should I do? Oh! That reminds me. So while Ryan is killing Carl, um, he's thinking, I wonder if I wash this shirt soon enough, if I could get the bloodstains out.",1,55,216
34,"And so he uh drags the body out of the elevator, oh no sorry, he's sitting in the elevator and then way back down on the first floor, the receptionist says I need to use the bathroom. And her favorite bathroom is up on like the 7th or 8th floor and she likes it the best because it has a slightly fancier hand soap dispenser. And so it sounds like she's going to go up to the elevator, but then she's like because of my new year's resolution, um, the elevator, she decides the stairs. And so that sounds like it's really good news, for Ryan who's still got Carl in the elevator, but Ryan has just decided to hide Carl's body at his house while he decides what to do with it, but he's going to take the stairs so that if the elevator ever opens on the floor, he won't just be seen there, um caught red-handed, because people don't like murderers. And so he um is walking down the stairs dragging this body, and as they approach the 6th floor, the receptionist lady is there, and she sees Ryan dragging the body, and he's covered in blood. So anyways, he's on the stairs, covered in blood. The receptionist sees him, and she's like freaked out, and she faints. And she's on the stairs so she falls backwards on her head, and she dies. Um the narrator says um oh well that was a real accident. And Ryan says like that's unfortunate, he thinks that's unfortunate, but it wasn't really his fault and so he carries Carl's body past her, being careful not to get any of his footprints into the um blood puddle on the ground.",1,72,289
35,"And meanwhile, Sarah, the lady on the 4th floor, feels like it's been hours since she's seen her lover, and so she decides to take some files up to the 7th floor to do some paperwork with the guy. His name I think is Carl, but I'm not sure. Um and as she's leaving, uh, Ryan comes in dragging the body, and she sees her lover covered in, uh, she sees him covered in blood and she faints um, but thankfully she's not on the staircase so she doesn't die, she just faints. And meanwhile Ryan is thinking, dead bodies, this must be what happens to women, and he has this whole fantasy about how she will um like love him again.",1,35,122
36,"And so at this point Ryan decides to take the body down the uh conveniently placed ladder outside the window that we can just never sneak past the security on the first floor, and it flashes down to the first floor, and we see the security guys basically screwing around and watching TV and not really doing anything. Um and so he uh heaves the body out to the uh, to the ladder, and of course he drops it, and the ladder is teetering, it's no longer propped up against the window, and Ryan is balancing on the top of it, and he sees into one of the floors, where he sees a janitor who's mopping the floors. And he suddenly realizes that a lot of people are probably trying to the get the same things that he's trying to do, like the same type of happiness, which is like a better job, a promotion, and a beautiful wife, and he's considering this as he's looking at the janitor, in one of the really weird moments, and he's just balancing on top of the stair, and I don't remember exactly what happens next, I think he just goes down the ladder and it ends. ",1,48,205
37,"And it's a cartoon and it starts with like this mountain with a big nose and eyes and it's just like sleeping on the earth, um and there's like all this weather happening and then there's this Ice Age and it sweeps him off the edge and now he's a big boulder. And he rolls along the ground. Um and he's just lying in the ground and like vegetation grows ",1,15,71
38,"He's asleep but then he wakes up because he's annoyed, oh no no no! He opens his eyes and he sees these like humans walking around and then he goes back to sleep. And then when he wakes up again, it's because these humans are making all this noise chopping wood and making these huts, primitive huts, and buildings and stuff. And he's really annoyed, because this guy is chopping this uh tree that's growing on his head, and so he gets up and he walks off. He finds this nice little hill to lie down on, he tries to sleep, but then the humans come with ropes and they grab him and drag him away and uh he's upset about this obviously. Um and they start chipping away at him and they make him into a um grain mill. And so he's spinning on this grain mill um grinding uh wheat into flour and ... that's powering him. And there's all these other stones that are like have eyes and are sentient and being used for various tools.",1,44,179
39,"And all of a sudden, there's these guys, these soldiers, in blue uniforms, and I think they're American revolutionaries and they see the big stone wheel, and they take it, and they break him up and make him into a cannon ball. So now he's this little round ball with a nose and eyes um and they load him into a cannon and shoot him at this enemy British ship and he breaks a mast, by a the ship sinks, and he gets broken into like little smaller pieces, and he floats to the bottom of the ocean, and then he uh, oh I can't remember exactly, he like washes up on shore,  He gets made into the cannon ball, he's at the bottom of the ocean,",1,31,128
40,"uhh, he washes up on the shore and somehow he gets taken into this like kind of industrial era um industrial era um town.",1,13,24
41,,0,,0
42,"But anyways he gets like thrown into a street, he's made into something else and then he gets thrown into the street, and then there's this upset guy who's kicking him. He kicks him along the street and eventually picks him up and throws him through a window, where his lady is at the table with this sort of foppish guy and the stone hits him in the head and bounces out another window and bounces out uh ",1,18,79
43,"bounces down off the city into like this beach and then he's lying on the sands and um this big uh like big truck like one of those big scooper things, picks him up and a bunch of sand and dumps him in a truck.",1,14,45
44,"And then the truck is taking him to a uh factory and they're being dumped on this conveyor belt which is taking him out to a giant vat of molten stuff. And the rock is really scared, and like this is the end, and he pours into the molten pot and he's reborn as this piece of glass. And then the piece of glass, there's these guys in like uh in uh dust coats, or not dust coats you know those bee suits, and it covers him, and then gets placed onto this satellite, which gets sent into space, ",1,27,100
45,"And then the piece of glass, there's these guys in like uh in uh dust coats, or not dust coats you know those bee suits, and it covers him, and then gets placed onto this satellite, which gets sent into space, and now he's really excited and then the satellite shoots its engines and the satellite runs into the asteroid belt where it crashes, which breaks the lens a little bit, and then he crashes back and forth until they finally uh crash land onto a planet. And then he's just alone on this planet, and um he's just alone on this planet and eventually somehow, he forms this big boulder again and the planet around him becomes terra form so there's these plants growing, he's getting into this big mountain again, he's a big mountain again, and he like wakes up and he looks around and he sees the big planet and it's all peaceful and he like sighs and then he relaxes and he falls back asleep.",1,44,169
46,"And um there's this tall, white guy, and um, he's like in this kind of picturesque village and um he's talking to this woman, and she's like you're new to this area, aren't you? And he's like, yes, and can I find a phone? Uh, can I borrow your phone and she's like I don't have a phone. Um the nearest phone is around the corner.",1,17,66
47,"And so he goes around the corner and there's this phone, but it's not like a normal public phone, it's like a cellphone, I think? And it's like what the 1970s thought what a cellphone is, like this long, L-shaped piece.Okay, um so the guy is talking on his cellphone, which is like this L-shaped piece of paper, L-shaped piece of plastic, and the operator is asking, what's your number? And he starts talking and the woman keeps going on like no, what's your number? So eventually he says, I don't have a number and the operator says if you don't have a number, then you can't make a call and so um shuts it off and stops so there's a dial tone.",1,28,123
48,"So he puts the phone down and then he wanders off and he finds this like display board, um with a bunch of buttons. And he's looking at it and eventually pushes this button, and all of a sudden right behind him, there's this woman, an Asian woman, with like really heavy eyeliner, um, driving a car, and she says, uh local taxi service, and then she said something in French and then he gets in. And he's like can you take me to the nearest uh town or something? And she says, local service only. And so he says just take me as far as you can go.",1,27,109
49,"And then they're driving along a sort of awkwardly quaint and perfect town, and he says to her, why did you speak to me in French? And she says well I thought you might be French. Well actually I thought you might be Polish or Czech. And he says why would you think I'm Polish or Czech? And he's like driving along, and she says well it's a very cosmopolitan town, you never know what sorts you will find. And so eventually they don't go very far and they stop, and he gets down, she looks at him and she's like, she's like, I did tell you, this is a local service. And he's on the sidewalk and she says that'll be 2 units and he's like, 2 what? Two units. And it's obvious he doesn't have any money so she says well, just pay me next time, and drives off. ",1,31,152
50,"Um so then he sees a store, a general store, and so he goes into it, and there's this shopkeeper, and a customer, and they're talking very loudly in a foreign language.",1,8,32
51,"And then they suddenly switch to English, and the man approaches the shopkeeper, and he's like, can I have a map of the local area? And the shopkeeper asks if he wants a small one, black and white, or color. And the man says I don't care. And so the guy goes and finds a map, and gives it to him. And it's a map of the local area and it doesn't have any details at all. Like there's like a town square, and it flashes all around, the camera flashes all around it, and like it says, mountains. And so it says mountains mountains mountains all the way around. And he's like, uh, can I have a bigger map? And the shopkeeper says it's in color, it costs more, it's more expensive, and he says that's fine. And so he pulls out another map, and the man unfolds it, and he sees, it's the exact same thing, but larger and in color, and the area's just surrounded with like mountain and there's like square and shop um it's like a really simplistic map. And he says to the shopkeeper, no you don't understand, I want a map of a larger area, like a map that covers a larger area, and the man says like oh we don't have that, no one asked after that ever, and the man is like, what? And he's confused, and then the shopkeeper says uh you're new around here, aren't you? And the man is confused, and, let's see, they're in the shop, I don't remember what happens next, I think it ends early after that. Yeah he leaves the shop and he's looking around, and then it just ends.",1,66,286
52,"It starts with this kind of like schleppy white guy who's just like looking really bored in front of a copier machine, he's making copies, majorly bored and the office is totally empty. And the um copier suddenly jams, especially the copy button, he doesn't know what's happening, and so then he like looks around and he takes the um he takes the copier machine and starts looking at it, it starts working again. And it prints out like this large piece of paper like larger than an 8 and a half by 11, um, which just has this giant, black circle on it. He looks at it and he looks inside the printer, or I mean the copier, and there's nothing there, except like a splash of ... which flashes of his face. He's like kind of confused and he just places the large sheet of paper with the black hole, the black circle, next to the printer, and he's drinking some water, and he puts down the cup on the piece of paper, but it disappears and he's like whoa.",1,44,182
53,"He's like kind of confused and he just places the large sheet of paper with the black hole, the black circle, next to the printer, and he's drinking some water, and he puts down the cup on the piece of paper, but it disappears and he's like whoa. And so then he looks a little closer at it, and he bends down and like looks at it carefully, and he reaches close so he sticks his hand next to it and he goes like a rraow sound so he pulls it back really fast and then he approaches again, he sticks his hand all the way into it, he pulls out his um plastic cup. So he picks it up, he's looking at it, and he's looking around, and he decides to go to the vending machine and he takes the black hole or the black circle to the front of the vending machine, ",1,35,155
54,"So he picks it up, he's looking at it, and he's looking around, and he decides to go to the vending machine and he takes the black hole or the black circle to the front of the vending machine, and he sticks his arm in, um and he pulls it back out with some candy, a chocolate bar. So then he's like eating this chocolate bar, looking at this piece of paper and he sees this door that says something like ""Do not enter"" or like ""Authorized personnel only"" and he gets an idea, ",1,20,95
55,"and so he sticks the paper on the door, and he sticks his hand through it and around the door and unlocks it from the inside and then he opens the door. Inside this office is a safe and so he tapes the piece of paper to the safe and he's looking around cautiously to make sure people aren't there, which he also stupidly doesn't shut the door so people can't see him, so the door is wide open. Um and he sticks his hand through and he pulls out this giant wad of bills that has like one of those little like rag key things around it. He's really excited, he reaches back in to grab more, and more and more, pretty soon he has a big pile. And he's reaching further and further into the safe, to get the last uh stacks of money. And pretty soon he sticks his head in, and as you probably could have guessed from the beginning, um, basically he reaches all the way in, and he climbs into the safe, and then the piece of paper falls down because the tape wasn't good, and then it falls down onto the floor, and then he's trapped inside the safe, and he's banging on it, and then the uh screen pans out to the safe, he's banging on it, and then it ends.",1,54,229
56,"Um and it starts with this uh man and woman in an office building, and they're doing something, kind of like sneaking looks at each other. And then maybe they're getting water. Um, they're in adjacent cubicles, making copies, and they're making copies like perfectly in sync, and then the copy machine then stops working, and so they have to repair it with paper, and they're refilling it in synchrony. And then they stand up and they're both making copies, and then they turn to face each other, and see that they're doing the exact same thing, and they look away.",1,23,101
57,"And then the man goes back to his cubicle, where he asks,  And then it follows the man going back to his cubicle, and on the cubicle, on his desk, he sees this blue folder. And when he opens it up, there's a smiley face made out of yellow Post-it notes. He's looking at this and he smiles, and kind of backs up in his wheely chair, he's looking around to see who made it, and as he's looking around, the woman from earlier leans out from her cubicle, looks at him, then turns back in. He's like aha, and certainly he's happy.So then he sees the smiley face,  he also reciprocates. she makes the smiley face.",1,26,119
58,"Uh the, let's see, so, um, she's in the bathroom and she's like washing her hands,  and then someone enters, no wait, he's washing his hands, and this guy enters, one of the, one of the stalls and he shuts it and there's a Post-it drawing on it, of a thought bubble with a heart in it, and it lines up perfectly with his head. He does something, and then there's the thought bubble. Yes, she makes the thought bubble for him, and then he makes the flower for her.",1,20,91
59,"So then it goes to the girl, and she's entering a um, entering this supply closet and she turns on the light and there's a flower made out of Post-it notes, like a pink flower, and her hand is perfectly positioned as if she's holding it,  and then she um runs around and she grabs all these Post-it notes and she has like this armload of Post-it notes and when she leaves she shoves the door, and right next to the door on the side it says something like ""only use office supplies for business purposes.” She obviously isn't doing it. So then she's walking down the hall, with her arms wrapped, carrying all of these Post-it notes, and she suddenly stops, suddenly, because she sees on this big wall, there's this big wall, and the guy has created this massive mural out of Post-it notes and the two of them, a pair of faces standing next to each other. And he's carefully placing these purple Post-it notes to make her hairclip, and he's standing there and turns around, and sees her, and she looks at him,  But she likes it and she smiles, and uh that's that. Yes, she makes the thought bubble for him, and then he makes the flower for her. And then he makes the face and there's something else she does for him but I don't remember what it was.",1,52,237
60,"and there's this guy with big over the ear white headphones, he's listening to music and he's waiting at a bus stop when this SUV comes off the highway, stops suddenly, and the door is still open, and this woman, like this harried woman rushes out, and she's talking on the public telephone.",1,12,53
61,"Uhh or something but it doesn't work and then she starts approaching him, he's still looking at her, and he's like this really pasty sweaty white guy, really pale, and as she's stomping towards him, the um her car is slowly rolling backwards. And then she asks him, can I use your phone? I won't steal it, I promise. And so he gives her his phone and she walks away. And so he gives her his phone and she walks away. And um she gets really angry and then she throws the phone on the ground and it breaks, and the guy is like what?",1,30,105
62,"And he goes over to the phone, he picks it up, and he's kneeling on the ground looking at his phone, and the woman's just standing there like crying, and he says, lady this phone is broken, could I have like 60 bucks to replace it? And she's really upset and isn't responding, and he's like, could you replace it, I just need some money, like you broke my phone.",1,28,70
63,"And then it flashes to this guy in another car and he has an earring on one ear, he's driving this old car and starting to approach, and then the guy with the headphones is like, wait, lady are you okay, miss, he calls her miss, are you okay miss? And they turn around and see this car, and he asks her, who's that miss? And then she starts running towards him, and there's this guy in the car with the earring who comes out and she starts swearing at him, ",1,18,92
64,"And then she starts running towards him, and there's this guy in the car with the earring who comes out and she starts swearing at him, she says fuck you and then the guy is saying, she'll be just fine, and it's all right, you should calm down, she'll be just fine, you'll see. She's like where is she where is she? And he says, it's okay, and she calls him a cock, which is awesome, and then um, the other guy whose phone was broken is approaching them and the old guy with the earring's like who's this guy?And the woman says oh it's just a friend.And she runs off and then the guy with the earring is like, uh, you're just a friend?And he's really aggressive and then the guy says no no no no no, I was just waiting at the bus stop, she asked to borrow my phone, and then she broke it, and I just want to get money for it, just like can I just get some money for the phone that she broke to replace it?And then he's like, the guy with the earring, is like, did you tell him who I am?He's asking like did you tell him who I am?And the guy suddenly, the guy with the phone, suddenly realizes and says, hey, you're that magician who works at the casino.He points at the woman and you're his assistant.",1,50,238
65,"Um so earlier, um when the guy on the phone is like aha you're the guy who's the magician, and you're his assistant, the woman who's the assistant pulls out her uh, pulls out a gun, and points it at the magician. The magician's like oh is that loaded? Well guess what, he does a little magic trick, and he pulls out his gun. And he says, I also have this gun, and this gun's from, it's a famous gun, and he's doing his little magician pattern, the woman gets angry and she takes the gun and fires it into the air.",1,22,102
66,"And um the woman rushes at him, and like they try to keep him separate and the guy the guy with his phone just leaves. And the woman's heading towards the car, and she's like trying to force the trunk of the car open because there's like banging inside it. And then the magician runs off towards the guy with the phone, he's like wait wait wait I have something to show you, and he unlocks this coffin in his handkerchief and inside the coffin is like this little mummy, and he starts mumbling this weird incantation and he's hypnotizing the guy with the phone, and meanwhile the woman is forcing open the trunk and she eventually opens it, and she sees what's inside, she steps back and covers her mouth.And um the magician meanwhile is finishing hypnotizing the guy with the phone who eventually collapses on the floor, on the ground, and his shopping bag falls open, and this like white liquid is falling out, and I thought he was dead, but then it turns it uh pans back to the screen, and he's just lying on the ground, and it turns out the white liquid was ice cream from this little carton,  And that's the point when the guy on the phone leaves the scene.",1,48,218
67,"and the magician he's looking at it and he's like oh crap! And he takes out this little notebook and he's like mumbling things, I think he's trying to figure out the incantation. But anyway, so he's on the ground, and there's spilled ice cream next to him, and the woman stalks back over and she's really angry because of what she found in the trunk. And then she shoots him and then the guy shoots her, so then they're both on the ground, dead, with this guy lying on the ground twitching next to the ice cream.And then he like gets on all fours, and he starts licking the ice cream on the floor and the white headphones are hanging around his neck with a cord trailing kind of like a leash.",1,26,133
68,"And then he starts barking and there's something, a dog, offscreen barking, and so this guy's crawling, he's barking, and kind of aggressively at this other dog approaches.And it turns out this other dog is this woman who's also apparently been hypnotized, and was probably in the trunk and so they're barking at each other and they're circling each other, um like sniffing each other's butts,and then they start walking off together, so the guy rolls on his stomach, and the other, the lady dog, lady, who's hypnotized to be a dog, is like sniffing at him and then they walk off.",1,24,102
