1,"We start off in what looks like the stage area for a TV show, and there's a host, and he's talking, and he invites to stage three guys. All of them are pretty young, in their late twenties, and they're wearing pilot clothes, and all of them for whatever reason are addressed to as Frank Abagnale. I think it's some kind of TV show where you're supposed to prove that one of them is Frank, or something like that. I think it's some kind of TV show where you're supposed to prove that one of them is Frank, or something like that. Okay, so the three guys walk to the three, whatever he calls those things in Jeopardy, and they're being asked questions,  ",1,39,125
2,"Okay, so the three guys walk to the three, whatever he calls those things in Jeopardy, and they're being asked questions, and the first question is for the guy on the left, and this lady asks him why he did what he did, and he gives this dry, boring answer, saying he just needed the money,  and then I think the TV show host, like the guy who's talking at the beginning, white hair, pretty old, asks Leonardo DiCaprio, who's sitting in the middle, who caught him, and he starts to remember, ",1,30,94
3,"and the scene cuts back to a flashback in Marseilles, in France, where we see a guy, his name is Carl Hanratty. He's like a policeman. He's got this hat, and he's talking to a bunch of people, trying to get somewhere, and it's raining, it's pretty bleak out, really like dark grey weather. He's Tom Hanks.",1,19,57
4,"He walks to this, what looks like this like French maximum security prison and is like let in and finally gets to the cell of Frank Abagnale, and I think he's there to, it says he's there to like prep him for a trial, pick him up for a trial.",1,16,50
5,"But Leonardo DiCaprio's not in very good shape. He's coughing a lot, he's got really long hair, he's like pretty dirty, he seems to be struggling, and finally he actually, during the conversation, he faints and kind of this persuades Carl to call up the French officers and ask for a doctor. He thinks it's an emergency, even though he was advised before not to like pass any food, kind of not to believe anything that Frank does.",1,22,78
6,"In any case, it becomes clear a little bit later that, from him talking to the French guys, that he's there to take him to America. They take Frank to this infirmary. It's like Carl and Frank and maybe like five other French officers with funny hats and mustaches, and Frank gets sat on this infirmary bed. He's the only guy there, he's coughing pretty violently, and then Carl is pretty, pretty adamant. He really wants a doctor for this guy. He doesn't want him to die before he gets him to America. He seems like he's after some kind of prize, and as they talk, and they kind of argue and bicker, they sort of lose sight of Frank, and at some point they hear this door open and realize that Frank has escaped.",1,35,135
7,"Then the scene cuts to Frank still coughing and walking really haphazardly through, through the prison as the other prisoners are like cheering him on, and finally he, the French officers and Carl catch up with him. Carl kind of gives him this look like ""Uch, Frank you did it again. You just never stop,"" and then Frank turns around and like lays on his, lays on his back, looks sort of resigned and is like, ""Okay, let's go,"" and the scene, the scene cuts, and that's it.",1,31,88
8,"It opens up in this indoor scene. We see this sort of woman, early thirties, red hair, kind of sitting around with a pizza, preparing to eat dinner. When she hears the doorbell and receives a record, and she takes the record, puts it on her record player, starts playing for a little bit.",1,19,54
9,"When she hears the doorbell and receives a record, and she takes the record, puts it on her record player, starts playing for a little bit. This like cute, peaceful song starts playing, and I think like accidentally she like pushes around the needle of the record player and realizes that when she does that, her pizza turns,  and she does that a few more times and realizes that basically what's going on is that the needle is, as the needle moves onto the record, it's controlling time. She moves it a little bit, she moves it up and down and notices her pizza going up and down and then the candle, the red candle that's going up and down at the same time as the pizza.",1,36,128
10,"She moves it a little further and finds herself in a completely different home, much different, much tidier, kind of white, like fancy, like a fancy mirror, there's some fancy characters around. She's maybe a little bit older, wearing some fancier clothes, and she realizes that she's pregnant and kind of feels around her belly and again like just moves the, moves the needle on the, the record player is still there, still playing the music. She moves the needle a little bit and notices her belly expanding and contracting, and then, I'm trying to remember when it was by accident, but she, so she hits the needle one more time, ",1,32,112
11,,0,,0
12,"and this time she's a little bit older, and she's actually maybe like 50 or 60. She's got gray hair. The scene changes again, and I don't remember where exactly she is. She's also in a different home. The baby's kind of gone, and she's trying to, she starts to not like this, she's trying to reach out to the needle to push it back to where it was. She's in a cast, so her leg accidentally hits the record player, and the needle advances even further.",1,19,87
13,"Now she's even older. She's got a walking aid, one of those walking aids, I don't know what you call them in English, and she tries to, she tries to hurry to move towards the record player, because she realizes that the record is about to reach the end, and she doesn't get there on time, and then the record ends, and the scene cuts again, and we see her, she's disappearing inside an urn, a purple urn with a white cross on it, so she's gone, she's dead, and I think that's where the clip ends, and the music is still playing.",1,24,103
14,"Okay, now the third clip, I think, this is the one with this dysfunctional couple, so got this couple, this woman with a close camera angle talking to this guy at dinner and realizes this guy is her husband, and she is, we hear about how it's their wedding anniversary. I guess like, they're both pretty young, they're maybe like early thirties, clearly, clearly pretty frustrated even though it's like romantic. She has candles on and stuff.",1,31,77
15,"The scene is pretty dark, pretty gloomy like pretty blue colors, also this blue Keurig, and then what happens, oh right, he doesn't get the hint, he continues to say very lame things. He says that the asparagus is very tender. She tries to, she tries to lure him into, into possibly having sex by alluding to the fact that the asparagus is a good aphrodisiac, and the guy before doesn't get the hint.",1,20,74
16,"She clearly gets more frustrated with him as the evening progresses until she basically snaps and is like, ""Uch, you can't be so mechanical. You're not a surgeon. You're just a computer analyst.” I don't know, she seems like she's trying to get him to do something, to say something, to make her feel something.",1,14,55
17,"She still is super frustrated, so she goes towards him at some point, oh, before that though, he starts smoking. He lights up a cigarette, she gets really angry at this and like, gets up from the table, walks towards him and takes his cigarette and is like, ""You can't, you can't be smoking. It's not what I'm expecting from my wedding anniversary.” He doesn't care, he lights a second cigarette, and then finally she walks towards him and starts caressing his neck and the back of his head, ",1,24,90
18,"She still is super frustrated, so she goes towards him at some point, oh, before that though, he starts smoking. He doesn't care, he lights a second cigarette, and then finally she walks towards him and starts caressing his neck and the back of his head, ",1,14,47
19,"and we, the camera cuts back to the back, and we see her fingers as she finds a button that was at the back of her husband's neck, and she turns him off basically, and he stops talking. So we realize at this point that he's a robot, he's some sort of android, and she goes to the back, she goes to the room, and starts browsing on her Apple.",1,18,70
20,"So we realize at this point that he's a robot, he's some sort of android, and she goes to the back, she goes to the room, and starts browsing on her Apple. She's in her bedroom, sitting on her bed, and we see her Apple computer, and we realize that she's browsing for this android company. She's browsing for new models of husbands that she can order. She sort of swipes through a few and seems to decide on one and then calls the company, the 1-800 number, and she's greeted by this female voice saying like, ""Oh, what seems to be the problem with your, with your model?” Trying to remember what she says, I think she says something like, oh, hes's something like, ""Not passionate enough. He's too boring"" basically, and the lady on the phone says, ""Well that's kind of a common, common thing. Do you, would you like, with this model, would you like another model?” She says, ""Yes. Could I have someone sportier?"" and it's funny, she picks this guy who's like a masseuse and a yoga instructor at the same time, a little scruffier, a little more athletic, less put together than her previous one,",1,49,201
21,"and then at some point you hear the doorbell ring. Some time must have passed, and you see this, there's a lady from the company, and there's another lady, and they unpack from a plastic-y weird thing, they unpack the second model and replace, take away the old guy. So the new guy comes to the table, sits in the same spot, and I think it's the wife that turns him on, using the same button in the back and picks up the conversation, saying, ""Oh the asparagus is really tender,"" ",1,28,92
22,"So the new guy comes to the table, sits in the same spot, and I think it's the wife that turns him on, using the same button in the back and picks up the conversation, saying, ""Oh the asparagus is really tender,""  This guy, however, the new guy, says the same thing about the asparagus, ""Oh it's really tender,"" and he actually says himself that some people say it's an aphrodisiac, and she's obviously really excited about this.",1,20,79
23,"At this point he gets up from the table and walks towards her and starts giving her a massage and asking her how her day went and this goes on for about a minute,  until finally we see, surprise, surprise, his fingers slipping to the back of her neck and he turns her off.",1,14,55
24,"It turns out she was an android as well. He turns her off, and he gets up and sits on the couch, puts his feet up, turns the TV on, and starts watching TV, and that's the end of this pretty weird clip.",1,10,43
25,"It's called The Shoe, so the camera, the scene opens up with this close-up of a shoe, and we realize that the shoe belongs to this guy, who's standing in the street, near the sidewalk, ",1,9,36
26,"He manages to open it. He looks inside, he looks inside to see whether the milk is good or something, and then he drinks it, and he seems very happy. The camera pans out, and we see we're in some kind of suburban sunny area, and there are cars on the road, and at some point this guy catches the eye of this other girl on the other side of the street, ",1,17,73
27,"and they kind of start getting into this sort of playful imitation game, where he does something funny with his hands, and she does something funny, and then they start sort of dancing in tandem and laughing. It's all really cute and stuff, until he gets too wrapped up in the game, and to her, to her great dismay, he gets run over by a car while he's, he's not looking, so he gets run over by this car.",1,18,79
28,"I think it was some sort of old 70s like reddish car, and the car doesn't manage to avoid him, and not only does it hit him, but it also skids out and hits this other car and jumps up in the air,  and this guy, I think, is thrown in some weird way, like he hits the windshield, the windshield shatters, and all we see is this shoe jumping into the air,  and then they have this, this sort of camera panning, showing us the trajectory of the shoe as it jumps through the air and falls onto the sidewalk, and then we get this camera move towards this other shoe, this black leathery shoe, and that's where this one ends.",1,37,124
29,"He's like this blue, slender, sinewy stick figure, and he has a hat, and he has a briefcase, and we see him as his car drives, he drives left to right because it's 2D, ",1,12,35
30,"He's like this blue, slender, sinewy stick figure, and he has a hat, and he has a briefcase, and we see him as his car drives, he drives left to right because it's 2D, and he gets off at his office, and we learn from the narration that he is about to get promoted, or so he thinks. He's getting amped up for this, gets prepared, and before, so he walks into the building of his work. This is an office building, and before going upstairs to his manager, oh, before that, there's a funny line about what his status in the company is, and apparently he's the most senior junior associate at this company. Right, so he first goes to his floor, and turns out he's officemates with this woman, I think her name is Sara, that he's been trying to woo, and we find out that he really likes her, and he often makes her coffee.He makes her coffee this time also, but she never seems to want his coffee.Even this time we see him giving her coffee, trying to do his usual thing, but then when he leaves, she pours the coffee out the window, like in kind of a cruel way, ",1,62,206
31,"I didn't get quite how this fit in, but the guy downstairs at human resources sees someone, sees some body fall out the window or something like that, I wasn't sure what was up with that.",1,7,36
32,"so we start feeling pretty sorry for this guy and kind of anticipate that no good can come out of this, and he, okay so he finally, like amps himself up, gets ready, like walks into the elevator and goes upstairs to get his promotion, and we hear that he's imagining the handshake. He's like seeing the moment unfold in front of his eyes. Unbeknownst to him, however, this whole time upstairs there's this guy named Patrick, also slender, tall, sinewy stick figure, talking to the boss, and we learn that Patrick's doing pretty well.He's actually being promoted himself, he's being promoted by the boss, rather than Keith, so we see Keith going up to the office as Patrick is walking out.Keith walks into the office and has this interaction with his boss and tries to look for the, look for the contract or something, but it's clear that he's not gonna get promoted, so he gets this news, he's pretty bummed, and he gets back in the elevator, goes downstairs and walks in on Sara, the girl he was into, making out with this guy, Patrick, who just got a promotion, so basically Patrick ends up getting everything that Keith ever wanted, ",1,58,204
33,"and he sort of stands there for a second, trying to process. Of course like, Patrick has no idea that, what's going through this guy's head. He walks into the elevator, and they, he and Keith are in the elevator, and Keith can see Patrick's reflection in the elevator door, like looking super confident, super happy with what just happened,  and I forget exactly why they start fighting, but, oh right, so I think Keith said some sort of profanity, swears at Patrick in some way, and Patrick gets really offended and punches Keith in the face, and they start, they start fighting, and you see all, you see this animated blood is spurted all over the walls of the elevator, and at some point, Keith realizes that actually, he actually killed Patrick. He actually kills him by taking the briefcase and sort of smashing it, smashing it over his, over Patrick's head, and so that's a bummer.",1,49,159
34,"Now he needs to figure out how to, how to get rid of this body, `cause he realizes that people will probably frown upon murder, people don't like murderers, according to the narrator, so Keith takes, starts carrying Patrick's body down the stairs. Patrick's really heavy, this is really hard, Anyway, but back to Keith and Patrick, so Keith is sort of carrying Patrick down the stairs,  but then there's this, there's this lady who works downstairs, who decides to take a break, goes up the stairs, runs into Keith as he's trying to carry Patrick out and basically like faints at the sight of them.",1,29,107
35,"At this point, Keith decides it's probably a bad plan to try to carry Patrick all the way downstairs, so he tries to carry him to his office and out the window onto this service ladder.  I don't remember exactly how, but Sara also ends up seeing them one more time and fainting as well. Keith has a revelation that yeah, probably this is how some women react to dead bodies, they just kind of faint.",1,21,77
36,"All right, so he tries to carry Patrick out the window, and I think, let's see, I'm going blank here, I think he probably, I think he dies himself. He manages to carry this guy, but then as he climbs the ladder, he like, I think the movie ends on him probably falling off the ladder as well.",1,19,58
37,"It's about a rock, so we see this big rock, it's stylized, it has only eyes and a nose, and it's not quite a rock, it's more like, more like a mountain,  and we see it as it looks around it and witnesses the, witnesses this little aquatic creature crawling onto, onto the earth. It's witnessing when the amphibians first got out of the water and became reptiles basically, and so we see the rock witnessing this, and the camera cuts to, to the time when there were dinosaurs, so we see a bunch of dinosaurs running around. There's a stegosaurus, a T-Rex, everything really lush with green.",1,33,109
38,"Then, I'm trying to remember how we end up, I'm blanking a little bit, but at some point, this rock ends up in a forest. It looks like it's much closer to contemporary times, it's kind of a, like, it has, leaves are pretty red, so must be fall time. There are animals around, and there are humans, there are workers in the forest, and this rock is like, it gets really sleepy and tries to go to sleep, but gets, gets, so these workers basically start to, how do I say this, I wish I was more bilingual,  okay, so these rock workers try to extract the rock, and they take her, and they basically turn her into a, into a mill rock, one of these things that you use to, to extract water from a mill. A millstone is what it's called, and still like this rock is kind of alive, and we see her persona. We see her like kind of yawning and witnessing all these things, and then, something, something fun happens, fun, unexpected.",1,56,179
39,"We see these, these Yankee, what looks like Yankee soldiers busting into these, into this mill, and we realize that we're sometime, this is happening sometime during the American Civil War, and these soldiers attack, attack the mill. There's a bit of, there's a fight, and they keep the rock, and they smash it to pieces, and they turn it into a, into a cannonball. Rock's still alive and now is a cannonball, and we see it as it flies out of, of this cannonball. There's a naval battle going on, and it flies and hits this other ship.",1,28,99
40,"I think it falls, I don't remember exactly where it falls, but I remember at some point she ends up in a forest, where she gets picked up by this Darwin-looking explorer guy, scientist guy, who sees it and gets super excited, because it turns out that there's a trilobite fossil on the other side of the rock, so he takes the rock and adds it to his collection, makes some notes and presents her at some expo, at some museum.",1,23,81
41,"This museum, we learn it's in Paris, how do we learn it's in Paris? Oh, it's because of, right, at this museum everyone's taking photos, there's lots of flashes and this sort of like rock is confused about everything that's going on, and she gets really startled when this horrendous looking boy, who reminds me of Darla from, from Finding Nemo, makes faces at the window, so, where she was, so the rock was in the window, she's like in this exhibit, and when this boy basically, how do I say this, like kind of like shows his face and startles the rock, she falls backwards and somehow manages to fall through the pipes and ends up, ends up on the sidewalk, is being kicked around by this French young dude with a hat.",1,42,134
42,"she falls backwards and somehow manages to fall through the pipes and ends up, ends up on the sidewalk, is being kicked around by this French young dude with a hat. He's sort of whistling and singing. This is Paris at night, we hear some French music playing in the background, and he picks up the rock and throws it at a window, and we realize it's probably his lover he's trying to get,  or he's throwing it at some random window, who knows, but I interpret it as he threw this rock at this window to get the attention of his lover, who's having dinner with this, with this other guy.",1,28,113
43,"And I'm blanking on what happened in between, but the rock, the rock finally ends up on a beach. It's really small at this point, so it started out as a big mountain. Now it's small, it has this kind of funny shape, and it's sort of early morning, we see this big bulldozer carrying and picking up a bunch of sand, together with the rock, ",1,16,67
44,"and it, the rock basically ends up in this glass-making factory, and we see it, together with other rocks, just kind of confused still, but she's together with other rocks like her on this assembly line, again like movie references reminding me of Toy Story, and she finally falls into this pit, this like cauldron where she gets melted and turned into, turned into sand and glass, and then finally she gets, she gets her moment of glory.",1,21,78
45,"She gets turned into, she gets turned into glass and gets slapped on, on top of this space telescope, and this telescope gets launched into, into the atmosphere and takes awesome, awesome photos of both galaxies far far away. However, at some point this mission, this mission goes wrong, and this telescope shatters among a bunch of asteroids and stars and somehow the pieces of glass turn out the rock on a planet that looks like Saturn,  and we cut back to later on when the rock, like after much much, like after a long time passes, again becomes a mountain like we saw at the beginning. We see the same kind of scene, she's very sleepy, wakes up, stares at the puddle of water in front of her, sort of like nice circular thing.",1,39,136
46,"So this guy, who's a forty or fifty-year-old guy, seems very put together, very sharp, ends up in this village that looks like the Wizard of Oz, and he has these sort of like funny, funny interactions. At first, he meets this old woman, doesn't quite manage to figure out where he is, trying to figure out where he is,  and then he asks where he can make a phone call, and he's directed by the woman to get out and turn the corner, where he'll find a phone booth.",1,26,91
47,,0,,0
48,"At the phone booth, he manages to call a taxi company, and the taxi company turns out, sends this lady, taxi driver in this kind of like, maybe motorized, maybe not, rickshaw type thing. This lady's, she's Asian, she's wearing a funny sort of like white doctor's hat and white, white red stripy shirt. She's wearing a little bit of makeup, and this guy, the, he's trying to ask her if, ""Will you please take me as far as you can to reach the next town, if you can,"" and she actually answers that, ""Well, I can't really take you to the next town. We only have the local service.”",1,34,110
49,So she sort of shows him around and finally drops him off at what seems to be the local store.,1,5,20
50,"This guy walks into the local store, it's kind of weird `cause he's wearing this sort of tailored suit that looks like it could be the 60s or 70s, but the store looks more like end of the century, so he doesn't seem to be, ",1,9,46
51,"he seems to be quite out of place there, and he gets in the store, and he talks to the store owner, and they have some conversation I can't remember, and then this guy asks for, asks for a map, and then the store owner is like, ""Okay, I'll give you a map.” He pulls out this cartoonish looking map, and our guy, the main character, he's kind of distressed. He's like, ""That's not really what I wanted.” The reason he's distressed is because the map shows this village, it's marked The Village on the map, and you see that the village is surrounded from all sides by mountains and water, so there seems to be like basically no way to get out of there. He's like, ""Okay, well maybe could you give me a map that just has a larger area? Maybe something with more detail, more color,"" and the store owner says, ""Okay, sure, I'll give you something that's in color,"" pulls out another map that's bigger and still this map is just like the last one. It is even bigger, it is more colorful, it has more detail inside about the village and about the different buildings, but still there's nothing, no information about the surrounding areas, shows only the mountains and the water, so this guy's kind of distressed, leaves the store.",1,54,226
52,"It's kind of late at night, and the light is off. You see this guy, like clearly like pretty frustrated, working late, and he's at the printer printing something out, and what he prints is this sort of like large size, like not what he wanted, like this large size picture of just a giant black circle, and he takes it out, takes it out from the printer, and kind of does other stuff with the printer,",1,22,77
53,"but then he sort of frustratingly throws his coffee cup, puts his coffee cup on the table where this picture is that he had laid down before, and he notices the coffee cup basically disappears inside this black circle. He's obviously very confused about what's going on and kind of tentatively tries to put his hand in. You can hear this sort of distinct, distinct wheezing noise, sounds like something out of Star Wars, sounds like there's something weird and supernatural about this print.",1,23,84
54,"He has the idea of, well after he puts his hand inside this, this hole, this hole made by this black circle, he has the idea to go to the vending machine and to press the print against the vending machine, and he puts his hand through it and realizes that he can actually take out all of the, all of the, he can take out the candy. So this circle has the property that wherever you put it, it basically removes all the obstacles between, between you and whatever thing was behind the obstacle. So he gets kind of greedy, he takes out all of these Snickers bars.He's kind of a weird guy, and he starts sort of snarfing down this Snickers bars, and then we see this sort of mischievous light come onto his face.",1,36,137
55,"He goes to a door left of the office. He places the, the print against the door, opens the door, we realize this door was locked, and then behind the door we see a safe, so we realize he's trying to go steal money. He's probably working in some kind of a bank or insurance office or something. He places the print against the safe door and starts pulling out, puts his hand through and starts pulling out wads of cash, more and more wads of cash, but then he again gets super greedy just like he did with the, with the candy,  and he kind of puts his hand too far away, and he accidentally, he falls inside the safe, and he falls with his entire body, and he can't get out, and because he's not holding the print anymore, we see the print, this hole is falling down to the floor,  so the portal between the safe and the outside has disappeared, and he gets locked in the safe. Then the camera pans out, and we just hear him kind of like desperately hitting, hitting the safe walls, but he's now locked inside the safe, and I think that's where the clip ends.",1,55,207
56,"So the one about post-it love is about two people, a guy and a girl, who work in the same office, big, sunny office,  and they meet at the printer, and they sort of meet each other's eyes and fall for each other, have a little crush on each other, and they're both sort of shy. He seems to be pretty shy, ",1,19,64
57,"So this guy returns to, returns to his desk, and he opens a folder and notices this smiley face made of blue post-its and realizes that it was probably made by the girl that he met at the printer. He's kind of happy and satisfied and leans back and realizes at the same time he's leaning back that she was leaning back, so they kind of catch each other's eye, and it's super cute, and then the scene cuts to her.",1,24,81
58,"She goes back to her office. For whatever reason, she has a slightly nicer office. It's upstairs, and it seems to be in enclosed quarters, um, andso she just got back to her office upstairs and I think opens a window or opens a cabinet door and finds this cute sun made out of yellow post-its and realizes that it was this, the guy that she met at the printer that she left the blue post-it smiley face for, and that's really cute.",1,20,83
59,"I forget if there's any other exchanges in between, but then we cut to her, to the girl going to the supply room and, at the office, and she sort of rummages through the supply room and gets, gathers all of the post-it decks that she can find. We assume that she's doing that to kind of have, to make something bigger and greater than before. So she takes all of these, she can barely carry them, walks out of the supply room, and as she walks out from the supply room, we see the camera sort of panning out, and in front of her is this entire wall-sized artwork made of post-its that shows the guy and her,just the heads and maybe like some clouds or some sun or some sky stuff above, but it's just sort of heads like leaning against each other and sort of smiling in a cute way, and then we see the guy kind of crouch down and putting the finishing touches and sticking more post-its to this artwork, and she's obviously like super surprised and happy to happen to see this, and he kind of turns around and smiles like, ""Yup, I did this,"" and I think, yeah, looks like a happy ending clip.",1,56,211
60,"So we're at this bus stop in what looks like Central New Jersey, based on the fact that we see New York in the background and the Freedom Tower, and we see this guy, and he's listening to music. He's wearing like white headphones. It's very warm outside, he's pretty sweaty, and he has a bag that we realize is full of strawberry ice cream that's kind of melting, and as he's waiting for his bus, there's no one else around except that this black SUV pulls over on the other side of the road, and we see the door open, and there's this woman who walks out of the SUV with curly red hair and wearing these like tights and kind of like floral coats and I think high heels, and she walks out of the car, looks kind of frustrated, walks around for a little bit. This guy that, just observes her as she, as she paces around. She's obviously pretty distressed, she forgets to put on the brake, the handbrake, so the car kind of starts spinning with the door open.She doesn't seem to care about that.",1,55,190
61,"She makes her way towards our guy, who's waiting at the bus stop and asks to use his cell phone. He's like, ""Yeah, sure,"" so she uses his cell phone to make a phone call. She's really angry with whoever, to whoever's she's talking to. I think she's asking, she says something like, ""Oh, what, what did you do to her? How could you?"" like obviously really angry, has this conversation, and then at the end of the conversation, she smashes the phone to the ground, to this guy's dismay and surprise, and he's obviously too tired, too hot to argue with her, ",1,28,104
62,"but he's like, ""Lady, can you kind of please give me back something like sixty dollars for this phone?""",1,4,19
63,"She doesn't seem to care, and then the camera pans over to, to this bridge that we realize is nearby, and we see a car approaching, and the car stops, and out of the car walks this guy, walks out this guy, tall guy, a little bit bald. He looks like he's wearing a suit, maybe suspenders, white shirt, and he's got this long face, big bulgy eyes. He's kind of funny looking, clearly knows the woman.",1,24,77
64,"The woman starts talking to him, and he seems to be the guy that she was calling. He's trying to be apologetic, but then he gets really angry when he realizes that the woman told this guy at the bus stop, who was just observing the whole thing, who he was. We learn about him that he was a magician or something, or the guy at the bus stop recognizes him as the magician at the casino, and then things get really weird. For whatever reason, this magician guy, oh so I should say this, the lady like keeps asking him, ""What did you do to her? What happened to her?”",1,26,111
65,"We don't know who she is, but at this point, she, so we focus on the magician, trying to remember when, I think the lady first pulls a gun out, pulls a gun on the magician, and the magician also pulls a gun on her. He kind of makes this magic trick happen, pulls out this small, what looks like a toy gun but is probably a real gun, and then the guy at the bus stop, who is still observing this whole thing, is obviously very confused. We see this image of him just kind of standing between the two of them as they point guns at each other, and then the lady starts walking towards the car.",1,25,119
66,"We see this image of him just kind of standing between the two of them as they point guns at each other, and then the lady starts walking towards the car. The magician pulls out some kind of box and starts talking to the, to the guy at the bus stop and tries to basically pull some magic trick on him. It's not, I'm trying to remember exactly what he does, but he says some words, sound like an incantation, opens the box, and in the box, as he does this,  we sort of have this weird angle where he's above, he's standing above the guy at the bus stop, and the guy at the bus stop gets more and more confused. We don't see exactly what happens to him, but we see what he sees, which is this box with this skin of something, maybe like the skin or this fossil or some sort of weird object that looks like a human in a fetal position. I don't know exactly what it was, can't pinpoint it, and we cut out of that scene, or we're still in the same scene,  but we cut out to the lady, and the lady goes to the car, opens the trunk, and in the trunk finds something or someone that gets her really, really upset,",1,55,224
67,"and she walks away from the trunk with her gun and points the gun at the magician, and the magician's like, ""Really? Are you gonna shoot me?"" and sure enough, she actually does shoot him,  and the magician, with kind of his last breath, he collapses on the pavement, like clearly he's bleeding, he's gonna die soon, but he manages to pull out his own little gun and shoots the woman, and yeah so they're both dead, ",1,21,79
68,"and we finally get to see what happened to the poor guy at the bus stop, and we realize that what happened to him, he's basically led to believe, or turned into a dog. He's still human, but he barks, and he walks on his, on his all fours, and he starts walking toward the car, barking and acting like a dog,  and out of the trunk comes this young woman, this like young, brunette woman we can only assume is the woman that the now dead red-headed woman was talking about on the phone, and she's barking as well, so she's also acting like a dog. She and the guy at the bus stop are now dogs, or think of themselves as dogs and start kind of sniffing each other, and then we just see them both walking on all of their, walking on their all fours, heading out, heading out into the sunlight of the great New York City skyline, and that's about it for this one.",1,43,170
