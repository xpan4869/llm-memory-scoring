1,"It comes out with the scene from like a game show with three men who all profess to be the same man, um but clearly only one of them is. And then the game show host tells the story of the assorted past of criminal acts and wrongdoing that this man in this military uniform had committed in this previous life and then they all take their seats.",1,20,68
2,"And then some kind of judge starts asking them questions, presumably to get more information about which of the three men is actually Abignail. And um she gets to the second man, who happens to be Leonardo di Caprio’s character, and he answers a question about whether, um you know who finally caught him.",1,18,54
3,"And it’s the Tom Hanks’ character, I don’t remember the name.  And we cut to Marseilles, France, I guess the day that he’s tracked down finally.  And Tom Hanks is trying to communicate with the French authorities for holding Leonardo di Caprio’s character in confinement.",1,15,47
4,"And um uh Tom Hank is granted access to speak to di Caprio um who is like clearly in bad shape, coughing, terrible cough, very ragged.",1,11,26
5,"And um uh Tom Hank is granted access to speak to di Caprio um who is like clearly in bad shape, coughing, terrible cough, very ragged. He’s very ill. And um, Tom Hanks starts to read from the declaration of human rights, and there’s a lot to get through. But then all of sudden Leonardo di Caprio keels over and then is unresponsive, so Tom Hanks’ character shouts for a doctor, that he needs a doctor.",1,30,76
6,"And then they bring him over um to the, they bring over di Caprio to like the hospital ward, whereupon the police, the French authorities wash their hands, and Tom Hanks demands that the doctor come, and the French authorities reply that the doctor will come tomorrow. And then Tom Hanks says, well if he dies here, I’m holding you responsible.  And they turn back and then the bed is empty. So di Caprio must have made a run for it.",1,23,82
7,"And um all the prisoners are hitting the rails because they you know, there's supposed to be, there’s like a break, someone might be free, gone free. And then di Caprio he’s running, he’s running, he’s running, he’s slowing down, he’s coughing, he’s on his knees, he’s crawling, he’s coughing. Finally like the whole entourage of un-imprisoned people show up and they go and catch up to him. And French authority personel person holds a gun to his head, so di Caprio stops, and then flips over and then says to the Tom Hanks character, “All right, let’s go home,” where I guess he’s gonna face charges.",1,34,107

14,"Um in another one, in the Boyfriend, um we are at a dinner scene, where a woman um and a man are eating silently. The woman seems more bothered by the way that it’s proceeding than the man does and the woman breaks in to offer the man a glass of wine and he refuses saying that he’s busy, he has like a big climb tomorrow, he has to work or something.",1,23,72
15,"The woman seems more bothered by the way that it’s proceeding than the man does and the woman breaks in to offer the man a glass of wine and he refuses saying that he’s busy, he has like a big climb tomorrow, he has to work or something. Well, well, she, she lets slip that it’s their anniversary, she drinks a whole glass of wine. He mentions that the asparagus is very tender. And she acknowledges this and remarks that um asparagus is an aphrodisiac and then he asks like, who says that, and she says, I don’t know, people say that, clearly not knowing either where that was from, not offering that as a fact, more of a suggestion. And then um then a few moments pass and he asks her how her day was, ",1,44,137
16,"and then she loses it because you know she like clearly went through all this trouble to make this dinner and she wanted to celebrate but he’s um pretty occupied, slash not really into it.",1,10,35
17,"So she goes over and she has this outburst, um, um, and she goes over to apologize for um having the expectation that later they’ll just have short mechanical sex, ",1,10,31
18,"and then she goes over and then to apologize extensively and then to hug him, and then you notice that there’s like a switch on the back of his neck.",1,7,30
19,"and then she goes over and then to apologize extensively and then to hug him, and then you notice that there’s like a switch on the back of his neck. And then she flips the switch off, and then his head drops immediately, revealing that he was a robot.",1,12,49
20,"So then we see her at her computer going to Prometheus robotics, the company that I guess manufactures um at least boyfriend robots. And we see her scrolling through various options and she’s on this page she’s intrigued by. She calls into customer service and reports her dissatisfaction with her current unit, um which um we learn is a member of the 100 series. She complains that it’s um unambitious and something else and then the customer service rep totally understands and acknowledges that this is a common malfunction in this line. So um she’s um you know she’s asked if she wants to upgrade to another model. She says yes, and now that she specifies the things that she wants, like a sportier model, and you know making it sound like it’s a car. Maybe like a masseuse rock climber, rock climbing masseuse, um not facial hair, but just maybe a five o’clock shadow. She says all these things.",1,50,160
21,"And then a little while later, Prometheus robotics people, delivery people come by, it's actually like two remarkably similar looking women deliver it, probably also robots. And then wrapped totally in plastic wrap, we see um this new guy um, the sportier model, come in and replace the now like decommissioned you know robot man at the table. And uh we uh as they’re wheeling him out, she goes over and asks them to stop for a moment. She kisses him on the lips um and removes the wedding ring and then puts the wedding band on the new guy and switches the new guy on.",1,34,106
22,"And then he is sort of uh boots up for a second, and then places the napkin on his lap and then it’s almost as if they’re picking up exactly where they left off, where she left off with the other guy. I’m guessing the memories come in there too. And uh he mentions that the asparagus is very tender, and then volunteers himself that it’s supposed to be an aphrodisiac, and then she says, she gets to ask, well who says that?",1,24,83
23,"And then he actually echoes what the other man robot had said, like in asking her how her day was, but then he follows it up by giving her a massage. So she starts to tell the story of her day, which included going into town to get some of the things for tonight, and a light lunch with Anna, and then because it was her anniversary, she decides to treat herself and he’s now in a position to switch her off, which he does.",1,19,85
24,"And um now she is switched off, and this is the big revelatory moment, because we realize that she too was a robot! And then so he goes over to the um couch and turns on the TV and then that clip ends.",1,12,43

30,"Um he’s this like blue figure, who he’s walking into work, and he’s super confident because today is promotion day. He’s been working, he's the most senior junior person analyst or something like that in the firm, so he’s pretty sure that this year’s his year, he’s going to be promoted and then when he’s promoted, this woman Sarah that he has a crush on, will finally like him. Um he always offers Sarah a cup of coffee, which she never wants. Um and then she dumps the coffee out, which um lands on like a window washer who falls off, and then somebody on another floor notices that someone’s just falling, and calls for an ambulance.",1,29,117

32,"And in any case, Keith Reynolds is um in the elevator where he sees the reflection on the shiny inside surface of the elevator, riding up to where he’s gonna chat with his boss. And then Patrick Reynolds, who we learn is his rival, has just come from that, and is feeling pretty good, because he’s heard some good news. And then Patrick Reynolds is heading down to tell his special someone, Sarah. And then Keith Reynolds goes to the office to hear that he’s been promoted, but is sorely disappointed of course to hear that he has not, so he isn’t feeling so good. He gets in the elevator again and then comes back down to the fourth floor. And then when the elevator opens, he sees Keith Reynolds, uh sorry, he sees Patrick Campbell, and Sarah kissing.",1,45,139
33,"And this is just the worst thing. So Patrick Reynolds comes into the elevator and then Keith Reynolds is feeling violent, and utters three words that we don’t learn the identity of, but it provokes a fight between them, and physical blows fall and yeah, Keith Reynolds kills Patrick Campbell. And so there’s this kind of like a bloody cartoons in the elevator. And then knowing that there’s blood all over the elevator, Keith Reynolds, all of this is calmly delivered in the VoiceOver.",1,30,84
34,"Keith Reynolds pulls Patrick onto one of the floors, um and then decides to pull him down the stairs instead of being exposed with the elevator, because someone has seemingly pointed, nobody likes a murderer. Um and then there’s another woman who’s on a lower floor who just wants to go all the way up to the seventh floor to wash her hands because it has the nice soap dispenser. So she takes the stairs, encounters Keith Reynolds and Patrick, bloody Patrick on the stairwell, and then faints. So then she’s now bloody too, and then Keith Reynolds proceeds, tries not to bump into her, and then he arrives on the fourth floor. ",1,31,114
35,"Sarah sees them, and she faints too, and then he decides, okay wow, there’s you know. He hopes for a moment that she’ll just run into his arms and then tell him that she likes him just the way he is, but that does not happen. She faints.",1,13,48
36,"And he notices that there’s conveniently a ladder propped outside, so he pulls Patrick to the windowsill and throws him out, and then he climbs onto the um elevator. And then he muses for a while as he’s just balanced on these like stilts, oh sorry, this ladder, and um he notices a man he’s never noticed before. Um the man who mops the floor in the office building. And then they lock gazes and then Keith Reynolds thinks about how um you know lots of people want the same things. You know, nice job, beautiful wife, you know this kind of pursuit of happiness thing, he muses about this. And um the man who mops the floor thinks about how he’s never seen such unusual sights, seeing Keith Reynolds just balancing there. And the clip ends.",1,41,137
37,"And it starts in prehistoric times, pre pre pre pre I don’t know pre Cambrian, like early early earth times. Um and it’s very sleepy, so it decides to close its eyes and take a nap. You see all this fun critters around it like the ones that are fossilized today as they I guess must have been these funky frogs and trilobites and so on. And as he’s sleeping, um the landscape around him changes. You see um an ice age occur and through erosion and various other kind of um tectonic changes, the rock has now kind of, sort of keeled over and sort of eroded a bit to become like more of a boulder.",1,35,117
38,"And then he wakes up and then thus begins a series of very disruptive encounters with animals and mostly humans, like there’s some wood choppers that start hacking away nearby, hacking a tree that’s growing on top of him. He finds, he’s super annoyed by this because it’s so noisy, so he gets up and walks into a forest and then um decides to find a spot to take a rest. And then as soon as he lies down and closes his eyes again, this anthropomorphized rock, um people come and wheel him away, and then grind him down, he sort of becomes like a mill stone, um, and so he’s like that for a while.",1,35,116
39,"And then um then there’s like soldiers who storm into that mill house, take him, and then grind him down into a cannon ball. So he’s like in the military for a while. Um and then as a cannon ball he like bursts through some mast of some ship I guess and then falls to the water and is passing along and then um is a bit small now.",1,19,69
40,"And then um another encounter is what looks like an archeologist identifies like a fossilized imprint of like a trilobite-ish looking thing on his back, and then so he goes to become an exhibit at the museum of natural history of some kind.",1,14,43
41,"And then um another encounter is what looks like an archeologist identifies like a fossilized imprint of like a trilobite-ish looking thing on his back, and then so he goes to become an exhibit at the museum of natural history of some kind. And then there’s some obnoxious child that startles him by pressing his face against the glass and so the rock falls back and then somehow ends up flying through some hidden chute system at the museum into a trash can um.",1,26,84
42,"And then that’s thrown out. Now um yeah, so, so you know, lots has changed, he’s like a rock now that can get kicked and thrown. He’s like thrown through a window at some point. Um, kicked around in the streets, steam rolls.",1,16,43
43,"Eventually he ends up on a beach as a grain of sand essentially. He’s like whoa, maybe now I can chill out and take a nap. And then all of a sudden as he closes his eyes, a big scoop comes and pulls him out again.",1,9,46
44,Um and then he’s like poured into a furnace with other grains of sand.,1,3,14
45,"You might think that that’s the end, but it’s not because now he is a shiny lens, or something for a telescope that is being launched into space. Um but I think there was some kind of accident and then one of the solar panels got broken by an asteroid and so he like crash lands on this other planet. Um and then on that planet eventually he becomes a mountain again. And then like a little pond and life appears and it seems to recapitulate the first scene.",1,26,89
46,"He’s in this cafe area and asks a woman server um you know where he is? And she says that he’s in the village. And then she observes that he must not be from around here. And then um he tries to ask for more specific information, but then she doesn’t give that, so he asks where the nearest phone is. And then she’s like, well we don’t have a phone, um but there’s a phone box around the corner",1,21,80
47,"and then the operator requires that he have a number in order to make a call, and so he doesn’t have a number, so he’s unable to make a call.",1,3,30
48,"Um and then he’s walking through town, and um there’s like a visitor center kiosk thing, pushes a button for a taxi, and then immediately a taxi appears, where a woman pulls up. she’s wearing all stripes and then she um greets him French, and then switches to English.",1,12,49
49,"He asks her why she started in French, and she says well it’s the common language, um and she says that I thought maybe you were um Polish or Czech. Um why would you think that, well she responds because the village is you know very cosmopolitan, you never know who you might meet. Um and you know she also mentions that this is only a local service, she can’t actually take him beyond the village, um and he just asks her to take him as far as possible. And they arrive as far as she can go, and then she requests payment of two units. Two units? Two credit units. And then his bewildered expression. He tells her like well you know he doesn’t know what’s going on so she just smiles and says that he can pay her next time. She drives off.",1,38,145
50,"He’s walking around and then he goes to a general store, where there’s a woman picking up some groceries, and then the grocer um asks the woman to help herself to a pineapple, which she then does, and then she takes her shopping, and leaves the store. And he has this like particular way of um saying goodbye to customers.",1,15,60
51,"Um and then um he asks the man, you know what he can do for him, and the man asks for a map, the map of the area. And the man says black and white or color? And then man says, it doesn’t matter, just a map. So the grocer um, the general store manager, he gets a black and white map out and then as the man rushes to open it up, he notices that like it's the way that a map would be labeled if it were a made up fantasy game world, like um very, very provincial, generic labels, for everything. Like the mountains, the mountains, the mountains, is how all the mountains are labeled. The village and lawn, like there’s a lawn in the village and it’s just labeled lawn. Um and the man asks for maybe a larger map. And then the man, um and then the grocer um general store manager brings out the color map, and it is indeed larger. There’s more paper involved, and it’s in color, but it’s basically the same. It depicts the same area. And then the man asks for a map that covers more area and then the general store manager says that that's not possible, they’re just not in demand, there’s only a map of the village. And the man walks out um.",1,65,226
52,"which is um kind of like a scene that’s shot kind of with a I don’t know, a blue-ish tint in like what looks like a windowless maybe basement copy room. Some really drab office space. And the male office worker is trying to Xerox some things and um presses the copy start key and then apparently nothing happens for a second, but then this ginormous sheet prints a big black circle on it. He’s like, okay, and he sets it down to his right.",1,26,85
53,"And then um absent-mindedly takes a sip from his plastic cup and then rests it, and puts it down, but then the cup’s not there. He notices. Maybe there’s something strange with that piece of paper. And then he waves his hands over it, nobody’s around. The copy job is going. Um and he puts his hand all the way in and then actually pulls out the cup. Umm so there’s some like volume where the cup could sit and then he pulled it out. And then he’s like oh wow. He picks the sheet up and then puts his arm through. And then thinks of um some ways to test you know what this uh apparent hole can allow him to do.",1,42,123
54,"So he brings it up to a vending machine and is able to steal some candy, at least a Snickers bar as we see in a later cut, munching on one. And then as he’s chewing the snickers bar, he catches sight of a door with a lot of meaning to him.",1,12,52
55,"And we learn quickly after that it’s a room with a safe in it. And then so he um uses the paper to undo the lock from the inside of the door. And then he goes in, and then he Scotch tapes the piece of paper onto the door of the safe, sticks his arm through, and pulls out a wad of cash. He gets greedy, pulls out more wads of cash.Nobody is around so he’s like okay I’m just gonna take out all the cash. I think he runs out of money he can reach to from the outside and so he decides to climb in. And then he climbs all the way in, and then the scotch tape sort of loses its grip on the wall and then um of the safe, and falls off, and then now the guy is trapped. He taps and that’s it.",1,33,149
56,"And there we’re introduced to um a young man and a young woman who are um in these side-by-side cubicles where they’re both copying some things. And then they’re kind of coordinated in their movements. They notice each other, they exchange quick glances. And so they each know that the other noticed the other person noticing.",1,21,56
57,"Then we see the man sit down at his desk, opens a blue folder he didn’t remember putting there, and there’s a pink smiley face made of just post-it notes in front of him. He’s like whoa, that’s strange. He wheels back a bit, wheels back a bit, tries to see if anyone nearby, might be nearby to claim to this deed. He wheels back a bit, wheels back a bit, tries to see if anyone nearby, might be nearby to claim to this deed. So thus begins this dialogue in post-it notes, flirty post-it note exchanges.",1,29,97
58,"He um makes a sun, a sort of a sun, representation of a sun on her window out of like yellowish orange-ish post-it notes. And she makes a kind of thought bubble, heart thought bubble post-it note art on a bathroom stall just behind where he was going to stand while he’s adjusting his tie.",1,17,55
59,"And then he makes a post-it note thing in like the supply room that’s like flowers. And then we see her coming out of a supply closet with a whole armful of post-its of various colors, sizes. And then she’s walking out, and then she looks surprised,  because in front of her is the guy nearly, like putting some finishing touches on a very like lifelike, realistic post-it note mosaic of their faces squished against one another like cheek-to-cheek, smiling in happiness with like hearts all around it.",1,28,89
60,"And there was a young dude standing at a bus stop with what looked like a gallon or a half-gallon of double strawberry ice cream  and it seems like a hot summer's day cuz it was melting fast and he was just waiting there in a very deserted corner for this bus. All of a sudden, this black SUV cruises into the frame and um this lady wearing um kind of what looks like night clothes, kind of like a night robe comes out and is looking pretty stressed out and um goes to the payphone. Um she seems to be in a hurry because she left her driver’s door um open and she doesn’t have any quarters or is not able to make the call using the payphone um, so does some mild abuse to the payphone and then um notices the guy standing at the corner of the bus stop and asks him if she can borrow his phone, assuring him that she won’t take it.",1,47,169
61,"so does some mild abuse to the payphone and then um notices the guy standing at the corner of the bus stop and asks him if she can borrow his phone, assuring him that she won’t take it. He hands it to her and she redials the number while she walks away and starts saying these things about how she’ll go to the police and she says that she’s here, she’s arrived. Um and then it seems like the other person has hung up at some point, um after that threat to go to the police, and then she smashes the phone on the ground, which startles the guy a bit more. Um he’s just trying to do a favor for this lady.",1,33,123
62,"And then he follows her because he’s wondering if he can at least get 60 bucks or something for the phone, because it’s clearly broken now. And she pretends not to hear him, or she’s just really, seems really focused on what’s bothering her.",1,14,44
63,"And then what comes into view is this man behind a steering wheel who pulls in, he’s in front of them, a few hundred feet away. And he comes out.",1,9,30
64,"And then she approaches the man who just stepped out. Clearly this was the meeting point and um he comes out and she asks him where her sister is, and he um anyway, he comes out and then asks her um who this other person is, and this is the guy with the broken phone. He’s like I don’t know her, um, you know he tries to explain how she broke his phone and so on. In any case, uh, he accuses the lady of telling the ice cream guy um who he is, and suddenly the ice cream, I’m going to call him the ice cream guy, um, realizes oh!You’re the stage magician, and you’re his assistant.",1,37,118
65,"And they both pull out guns being the magician and the assistant, the lady. Um and now ice cream guy is super freaked out, um.",1,7,25
66,"Then the magician starts to, starts some incantation, which is like a this weird uh coffin like small version of a coffin and a handkerchief and um starts saying words and then the guy seems to pass out and then faint and fall. And then um and then the woman opens the trunk and is really aghast by what she sees, although we don’t get to see what she sees just yet.",1,26,72
67,"Um and then she comes over with a gun, she shoots him. The magician on the ground shoots her. They’re both dead. The guy wakes up, starts licking the melted ice cream.",1,9,32
68,"He is now barking like a dog.  He is now barking at some other barking, and the barking continues. Turns out the other barking is probably from the sister that was in the trunk. And now they are, I think they are dogs, and they’re barking, and then they leave.",1,12,51
