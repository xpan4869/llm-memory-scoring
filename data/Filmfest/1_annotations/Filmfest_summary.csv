"the record","A woman receives a vinyl record titled A Single Life. When she plays it, she discovers the record controls time: spinning it forward ages her, while rewinding restores the past. She experiments—pregnancy, motherhood, childhood, old age—each phase flashing by as she manipulates the needle. Ultimately, the record reaches its end: the woman becomes elderly, then vanishes entirely, leaving only an urn behind as the song concludes."
"the boyfriend","A woman and her partner share a tense anniversary dinner. He refuses wine, citing work, and their conversation turns strained. She lashes out, throwing wine on him and mocking his seriousness. He smokes despite her protests, and their bickering escalates. Suddenly, she tenderly apologizes and embraces him—only to switch him off, revealing he is a humanoid robot. She calls tech support to request a replacement model, ordering a more “adventurous” man. The new partner is delivered, and the cycle repeats: at dinner, he massages her, then flips the switch on her neck, revealing she too is a robot. The story ends with him taking her place, mirroring her earlier actions."
"the shoe","A whimsical short where a shoe comes to life, dancing to music. A man drinks milk, flirts with a woman, and mimics her playful gestures. Distracted, he stumbles into traffic and is struck by a car, which crashes spectacularly. In the wreckage, the man’s shoe flies through the air and lands beside another battered shoe, closing the loop."
"keith reynolds","Keith Reynolds, a timid office worker, hopes for a promotion to win the affection of Sarah. Instead, her lover Patrick receives it. Overcome with jealousy, Keith confronts Patrick, and a fight in an elevator escalates until Keith accidentally kills him. Trying to cover it up, Keith drags the body through the building but causes more deaths along the way. His clumsy attempts at concealment spiral into dark absurdity, with narration highlighting his insecurity and longing for Sarah."
"the rock","A sentient mountain-turned-rock witnesses history unfold across millennia. It is exploited by humans—cut down, carted away, ground into flour, forged into a cannonball, displayed in a museum, discarded as trash, crushed into sand, melted into glass, and finally launched into space as a telescope lens. Cracked and adrift, it crashes onto the moon, where it regrows into a mountain once again, finally resting."
"the prisoner","A man wakes in a mysterious seaside village. Locals evade his questions, offering only vague answers. Phones and maps prove useless: all communication loops back into the village itself. He discovers the economy runs on “credit units” and encounters the strange farewell, “be seeing you.” Everywhere he turns, he is stonewalled, trapped in a place where escape and outside contact seem impossible."
"the black hole","An office worker discovers a mysterious black hole printed on a piece of paper. At first he uses it to retrieve lost objects and steal snacks, then greed overtakes him. He sticks the black hole onto a safe and begins looting cash. When he climbs inside to reach more, the paper slips off, trapping him forever in the safe."
"post-it love","Two shy office workers flirt silently through post-it note messages and designs. What starts with smiley faces and a sun grows into elaborate murals. Their quiet connection culminates when the woman discovers the man creating a giant mural of their faces together. She smiles tearfully, realizing his affection."
"bus stop","On a sweltering day, a man waits for a bus with melting ice cream when a distressed woman borrows his phone. Her violent partner, Aldini—a stage magician—arrives, and tensions escalate into a surreal, violent standoff. Gunfire erupts, and the stranger is left crawling on the ground, barking like a dog after Aldini’s incantation. In a shocking finale, he meets a girl also barking like a dog, and the two crawl off together, animal-like, into uncertainty."
