"a study in pink","The story begins with a lighthearted old cinema interlude, contrasting sharply with scenes of gunfire and John Watson’s traumatic battlefield memories. John, a war veteran, suffers from nightmares, insomnia, and a psychosomatic limp. He is in therapy, where his psychotherapist suggests writing a blog to help him adjust to civilian life. John insists, “Nothing happens to me.” He is lonely, broke, and restless. Meanwhile, London is shaken by a series of apparent suicides. Sir Jeffrey Patterson, a government official, dies after swallowing red-and-white pills. An 18-year-old boy and junior minister Beth Davenport also die in similar circumstances. Each leaves no suicide note, raising suspicion. At a press conference, Detective Inspector Lestrade calls them linked suicides, but the media challenges the idea. Midway through, reporters and police simultaneously receive anonymous texts: “Wrong!” signed “SH.” John’s old acquaintance, Mike Stamford, introduces him to Sherlock Holmes, a brilliant but eccentric consulting detective seeking a flatmate. Sherlock’s deductions about John—his military service, estrangement from his brother/sister “Harry,” and psychosomatic limp—stun him. Despite Sherlock’s blunt arrogance, John is intrigued. They move into 221B Baker Street with Mrs. Hudson as landlady. Lestrade arrives with news of a fourth “suicide” at Lauriston Gardens—this one leaving a note. Sherlock leaps at the chance and invites John along. At the crime scene, Sherlock observes Jennifer Wilson, dressed in pink. He deduces she was a married woman with many affairs, visiting from Cardiff. The word “Rache” scratched near her hand isn’t “revenge” in German but “Rachel,” cut short as she died. Sherlock insists her missing suitcase is vital. When Lestrade denies its existence, Sherlock concludes it’s murder, not suicide—someone removed the case. Left behind, John is unsettled but fascinated. He is warned by Sergeant Donovan that Sherlock is a “psychopath” who enjoys crime scenes too much. Soon after, John is mysteriously contacted through public phones and led to a warehouse. There, he meets a calm, umbrella-carrying man (later implied to be Moriarty’s agent, Mycroft Holmes in disguise in the show). This man offers John money to spy on Sherlock, warning him that Sherlock is dangerous. John refuses. The man chillingly suggests John misses the battlefield more than he admits. Back at Baker Street, Sherlock reveals he found Jennifer Wilson’s missing pink suitcase in a rubbish skip—proving she never reached her hotel. He has John text her phone, knowing the killer has it. The phone rings back immediately, confirming the murderer is holding it. Sherlock gleefully declares they are dealing with a serial killer. He dismisses police involvement, dragging John along instead. Despite his doubts, John is captivated. Sherlock explains his reasoning: the killer coerces victims into swallowing one of two pills, one harmless and one fatal, forcing them into a “suicide game.” The deaths are therefore disguised murders. Jennifer’s phone is key bait. Meanwhile, Sherlock demonstrates his brilliance to John in the taxi—deducing his background from tiny details, such as scratches on his phone and his psychosomatic limp. John, impressed, begins to admire Sherlock’s genius despite his arrogance. Eventually, Sherlock arranges a meeting with the killer through the text. He leaves Baker Street with John reluctantly following. The murderer turns out to be a taxi driver—unassuming but deadly. He lures victims by challenging them to a fatal game: two identical pills, one safe, one poisoned. The victims, believing they choose freely, actually fall into his psychological manipulation. The cabbie boasts that his victims always “choose wrong.” In a tense standoff, the cabbie tries to tempt Sherlock into playing. Sherlock, fascinated, nearly gives in. But John, watching from a distance with his pistol (retrieved earlier from his drawer), shoots the cabbie through a window, saving Sherlock’s life. The killer dies before fully revealing who sponsored him, but hints at a powerful figure watching everything. At the crime scene aftermath, Lestrade praises Sherlock. Sherlock, however, is preoccupied with the bigger picture: the shadowy “sponsor” who orchestrated the murders. Back at Baker Street, Sherlock and John settle into an uneasy but compelling partnership. John, despite warnings, decides he enjoys the danger. Sherlock relishes the excitement, declaring: “The game is on.”"
