"Police Press Conference Room. Camera has viewpoint of a reporter. Detective Inspector Lestrade sits uncomfortably at the table in front of the press while his colleague, Detective Sergeant Sally Donovan addresses the reporters.

Okay, if there are no more questions for Detective Inspector Lestrade…""  Donovan continues: ""…I'm going to bring this session to an end."" Lestrade remains silent and seated beside her.  Reporter 2 asks: "" But if they're suicides, what are you investigating?"" Lestrade answers with his hands together: ""As I say, these…these suicides are clearly linked.

Donovan covers her mouth and murmurs to Lestrade: ""Daily Mail."" She is warning Lestrade to watch what he says.  Lestrade grimaces and looks at the reporters again. He says: ""Obviously this is a frightening time for people, but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions."" Lestrade continues: ""We are all as safe as we want to be.""

"John is walking with a limp through Russell Square Park with his cane looking preoccupied.  John passes by a bench in the park where a man dressed in a beige jacket with a suit and tie and glasses calls out ""John! John Watson!""  John turns around as the man approaches.  The man walks closer and introduces himself saying: ""Stamford. Mike Stamford.We were at Bart's together."" John recognises him and says ""Yes sorry, yes, Mike, hello, hi.""

John, trying to sound convincing, says: ""No."" Mike: ""I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at, what happened?"" John looks down awkwardly at his leg and looks back up and awkwardly says: ""I got shot.""  Mike's smile disappears and they both seem embarassed John and Mike are sitting down together at a park bench, each with a coffee in their hand.

John replies: ""I can't afford London on an army pension."" Mike: ""Ah, and you couldn't bear to be anywhere else. That's not the John Watson I know."" John uncomfortably says: ""Yeah, I'm not the John Watson…"" and never finishes his sentence. Mike awkwardly looks away and drinks his coffee. John switches his own cup to his right hand and looks down at his left hand, clenching it into a fist as he tries to control the tremor that has started.  Mike looks at John again and asks: ""Couldn't Harry help?"" John scoffs and sarcasitcally says: ""Yeah, like that's going to happen."" Mike shrugs and suggests: ""I dunno- get a flatshare or something? John says: ""Come on, who would want me for a flat mate?"" Mike chuckles and John looks at him wonderingly.  John asks :""What?"" Mike says: ""Well, you're the second person to say that to me today."" John asks: ""Who was the first?""",14

A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.""  Molly shyly looks up at Sherlock and says: ""Listen, I was wondering, maybe later…"" Sherlock glanes at her while he is writing, then does a double-take and frowns at her. Molly continues: ""…when you're finished…""  Sherlock interrupts her and asks: ""Are you wearing lipstick? You weren't wearing lipstick before."" Molly nervously says: ""I, uh, I refreshed it a bit."" She smiles at him flirtatiously.  Sherlock gives a long oblivious look, then goes back to writing in his notebook. Sherlock reumes his note taking and says ""Sorry, you were saying?"" Molly gazes at him intently and says: ""I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee.""

Sometimes I don't talk for days on end."" Sherlock looks round at John and says: ""Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other."" He throws a hideously false smile at John John looks at Sherlock blanky for a moment then looks round at Mike John looks in Mike's direction and says: ""Oh you…you told him about me?"" Mike shakes his head while holding a lab sample and says: ""Not a word."" John looks down then up round Sherlock and asks: ""Then who said anything about flatmates?"" Sherlock has his back to John and as he is grabbing his black coat he says: ""I did."" Sherlock continues: ""Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from Afghanistan."" while putting on his coat and grabbing a blue scarf Sherlock, while putting on his scarf,  looks at John and continues: "" Wasn't that difficult a leap.""

Sherlock looks in Mike's direction then back at John and says: ""Problem?"" John smiles incredulously and looks at Mike.  Mike stares at Sherlock with a smug smile.  John turns back to Sherlock and says: ""We don't know a thing about each other; I don't know where we're meeting; I don't even know your name."" Sherlock pauses and looks closely at John Sherlock looks intently at John and says very quickly and precisely: "" I know you're an Army doctor and you've been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you've got a brother who's worried about you, but you won't go to him for help because you don't approve of him - possibly because he's an alcoholic..."" John looks dumbfounded and stares at Sherlock as Sherlock continues ""….more likely because he recently walked out on his wife."" Shot of Sherlock as he continues: ""…And I know that your therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic…"" Sherlock glances down at John's legs.  John also glances down at his legs and cane and shuffles his feet awkwardly. Sherlock says: ""Quite correctly, I'm afraid.""  Sherlock smugly says: ""That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?"". He walks toward the door to leave.  John stands still awkwardly. The sound of the door closing and Sherlock leaving is heard, shortly followed by the sound of it re-opening.  Sherlock leans back into the room and says to John: "" The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is two two one B Baker street."" He click-winks at John.  Sherlock looks at Mike and says: ""Afternoon."" He then exits the room. Mike raises a finger in farewell as the door shurts behind Sherlock.

"Continuous shot as a sign that says: ""Baker Street W1, City of Westminister"" appears and then camera pans to the left to show John walking with his cane while a black taxi pulls up on the side of the road.

Sherlock reaches in through the window of the cab and hands some money to the driver then says a quick: ""Thank you.""  John turns around toward Sherlock and says : ""Ah, Mr. Holmes."" Sherlock walks toward John and says: ""Sherlock, please."" The two shake hands.  John looks at the door, then looks around the area and says: ""Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive."" Sherlock looks around as well with his hands behind his back.  Sherlock has his hands behind his back while he looks around the street and says: ""Oh, Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, she's giving me a special deal. Owes me a favour. A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out.""  John: ""Sorry - you stopped her husband being executed?""

Mrs. Hudson says a warm ""Hello"" to John. John says: ""How do?"" Mrs. Hudson gestures John inside and says: ""Come in."" John says: ""Thank you"" and goes in the building.  Sherlock says: ""Shall we?"" and follows behind John inside the house with his hands behind his back. Mrs. Hudson closes the door behind them.  A view of the door that says: 221B Sherlock trots up the stairs to the first floor landing, then pauses and waits for John. John hobbles up the stairs.  Sherlock opens the door for John and they both go in. John takes time to look around the flat.  John's point of view as he looks around the room. It is quite messy and there are boxes everywhere.  John walks around the room and heads toward the kitchen as he says: ""Well, this could be very nice. Very nice indeed."" Sherlock also looks around the flat happily and says: ""Yes. Yes, I think so. My thoughts precisely."" Sherlock: ""So I went straight ahead and moved in."" John simultaneously says: ""Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out…""  John and Sherlock awkwardly look at each other and John says: ""Oh."" Sherlock walks across the room and makes a half-hearted attempt to tidy up a little. John trails off: ""So this is all…"" as Sherlock says: ""Well, obviously I can, um, straighten things up a bit."" Sherlock throws a couple of folders into a box and then takes some apparently unopened envelopes across to the fireplace where he puts them onto the mantelpiece and then stabs a multi-tool knife into them. John points to something on the mantelpiece with his cane and says: ""It's a skull."" Sherlock awkwardly looks at the skull and says: ""Friend of mine."" Then trails off: ""When I say friend…"" as he moves across the room Mrs. Hudson walks into the room and says to John: ""What do you think, then, Doctor Watson? There's another bedroom upstairs of you'll be needing two bedrooms."" while Sherlock walks across; removing his coat and scarf.  John says: ""Of course we'll be needing two."" with a puzzeled look. Mrs Hudson: ""Oh, don't worry; there's all sorts round here."" (Dropping her voice confidentially) ""Mrs Turner next door's got married ones."" John has an incredulous look as he looks from Mrs. Hudson round to Sherlock, expecting him to confirm that he and John are not involved in that way.  Sherlock is seen organizing books from boxes onto a bookshelf. He seems oblivious to what is being insinuated by Mrs. Hudson.  Mrs. Hudson looks back round to Sherlock as she is walking toward the kitchen and says: ""Oh, Sherlock…"" Sherlock looks up from his organizing work at Mrs. Hudson.  Mrs. Hudson continues in a motherly tone: ""The mess you've made…"" Then she starts tidying up the kitchen.

Sherlock stops his work and puts his hands into his pant pockets and nonchalantly asks: ""Anything interesting?"" John: ""Found your website, The Science of Deduction."" Sherlock, with a proud smile, asks: ""What did you think?"" John throws him a ""you have got to be kidding me type of look."" Sherlock looks surprised and a little hurt at the same time.  John looks up at Sherlock and explains: ""You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airplane pilot by his left thumb."" Sherlock replies: ""Yes, and I can read your military career in your face and your leg…"" John looks up and stares at Sherlock intently as Sherlock finishes saying: ""…and your brother's drinking habits in your mobile phone.""

Sherlock asks: ""Where?"" with a concerned look. Lestrade replies: ""Brixton, Lauriston Gardens."" Sherlock states: ""What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to be if there wasn't something different."" Lestrade says: ""You know how they never leave notes?"" Sherlock says: ""Yeah"" in the background. Lestrade continues: ""This one did."" Sherlock looks intrigued. Lestrade asks: ""Will you come?"" Sherlock asks Lestrade: ""Who's on forensics?"" Lestrade answers: ""It's Anderson."" Sherlock grimaces and says: ""Anderson won't work with me."" Shot of John sitting down on a chair with his right hand on his cane standing upright on the floor and keenly looking at Sherlock as he is speaking.  Lestrade states: ""Well, he won't be your assistant."" Sherlock insistingly says: ""I NEED and assistant."" Lestrade, seemingly a little exasperated, asks again: ""Will you come?"" Sherlock replies: ""Not in a police car. I'll be right behind.""  Lestrade gives a little bow and says: ""Thank you."" He looks around at John and Mrs. Hudson, who is standing by the kitchen entrance, for a moment. Then he turns and hurries off down the stairs. John looks puzzeled as he looks back at Lestrade leaving the room then looks round at Sherlock.  Sherlock waits until Lestrade has reched the front door. He is looking outside the window. He hears the sound of the door closing shut.  Sherlock smiles and leaps into the air and clenches his fists triumphantly while saying : ""BRILLIANT!"" Sherlock shouts: ""Yes!"" He happily twirls around the room as he says: ""Ah, four serial suicides, and now a note! Oh, it's Christmas."" Sherlock grabs his coat and puts it on while says: ""Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late. Might need some food"" and walks into the kitchen.  Mrs. Hudson is standing by the entrance of the kitchen and says to Sherlock: ""I'm your landlady dear, not your housekeeper."" Sherlock replies: ""Something cold will do"" as he puts on a scarf. Sherlock adds: ""John, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home"" then grabs a small leather pouche from the kitchen table.  Sherlock opens the door to the stairway and says: ""Don’t wait up!"" and leaves the room.  Mrs. Hudson turns to John who is still sititing down and says: ""Look at him, dashing about! My husband was just the same.""",22
"John grimaces at the repeated implication that he and Sherlock are an item. Mrs. Hudson looks at John and observes: ""But, you're more the sitting down type, I can tell."" Mrs. Hudson turns and walks toward the door and says: ""I'll make you that cuppa. You rest your leg."" John looks very annoyed.  John shouts: ""DAMN MY LEG!"" and Mrs. Hudson jumps and turns around surprised.  John immediately apologizes and bashes his leg with his cane saying: ""Sorry, I'm so sorry. It's just sometimes this bloody thing…"" as Mrs. Hudson walks back toward John.  Mrs. Hudson says: ""I understand dear, I've got a hip"" and turns around toward the door again.  John sounds frustrated as he says: ""Cup of tea'd be lovely, thank you"" and he grabs a newspaper on the right arm of his chair.  Mrs. Hudson notes: ""Just this once, dear, I'm not your housekeeper"" and starts to walk out of the door.  John adds just as Mrs. Hudson is about to leave the room: ""Couple of biscuits too, if you've got'em"", then opens the newspaper in his hands. Mrs. Hudson comes back in half-way.  Mrs. Hudson says: ""Not your housekeeper!"" then leaves the room.  John looks closely at the front-page article of the newspaper and folds the half of the newspaper that he is reading.  There is a sound of someone opening a door in the background. John looks at the article reporting Beth Davenport'apparent suicide. Next to a large photograph of Beth is a smaller one showing the man who just visited the flat and identifying him at D.I. Lestrade. The byline is ""Serial Cults.""",23
"Before John can read on, Sherlock's voice interrupts him stating: ""You're a doctor."" John looks up and sees him standing at the living room door. Sherlock continues: ""In fact, you're an army doctor"" while putting on a pair of black gloves.  John says : ""Yes"" and stands up from the chair with his cane with a small grunt. Sherlock asks: ""Any good?"" John says: ""Very good."" Sherlock says: ""Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths..."" while walking closer to John. John replies: ""Mmm, yes."" Sherlock continues to walk toward John.  Sherlock continues: ""Bit of trouble too, I bet"" and stops his tracks in front of John.  John replies in a serious tone: ""Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime. Far too much."" Sherlock pauses for a moment and asks: ""Wanna see some more?"" John says fervently: ""Oh God, yes.""  Sherlock immediately turns around to go out and John quickly follows.  Sherlock quickly runs down the stairs. John is seen following behind. A shot of Sherlock's back as he goes down the stairs. John calls out: ""Sorry, Mrs. Hudson, I'll skip the tea. Off out.""  Continued shot of Sherlock's backside. Mrs. Hudson asks: ""Both of you?"" Sherlock has almost reach the front door but he stops.   Sherlock turns around and walks toward Mrs. Hudson who is standing near the bottom of the stairs. He excitedly says: ""Impossible suicides? Four of them? There's no point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on!"" Sherlock takes Mrs. Hudson by the shoulders and kisses her noisily on the cheek.  John is at the bottom of the stairs as he watches. Mrs. Hudson says: ""Look at you, all happy. It's not decent"", but she can't help but smile.  Sherlock turns around and walks toward the door saying: ""Who care about decent? The game, Mrs. Hudson, is on!"" John is seen following behind  Sherlock goes out of the front door and he walks out onto the street. Sherlock turns around and hails an approaching black cab. He yells out: ""Taxi!""  John follows behind and waits for the taxi to pull up with Sherlock. A black taxi pulls up on the side of the road and Sherlock, then John get into the taxi.  The taxi signals to the left and merges with traffic to join the main road. ",24
"Frontal view of Sherlock sitting in the taxi with his eyes fixed on his smartphone. It is now dark outside.  A side view of sherlock's face as he continues to look at his phone. John keeps stealing nervous glances at him in the background Sherlock notices this with a sideglance at John. He takes his eyes off his phone and looks away then looks back at John.  Sherlock takes a deep breath and states: ""Okay, you've got questions.""  John says: ""Yeah, where are we going?"" Sherlock replies: ""Crime scene. Next?"" John replies: ""Who are you? What do you do?"" and looks toward Sherlock.  Sherlock asks: ""What do you think?""  John slowly and hesitantly says: ""I'd say private detective…"" Sherlock asks: ""But?"" John turns toward Sherlock and says: ""…but the police don't go to private detectives."" Sherlock smiles and says: ""I'm a consulting detective. Only one in the world. I invented the job."" John asks: ""What does that mean?""  Sherlock elaborates: ""It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me."" John laughs, looks at Sherlock and says: ""The police don't consult amateurs.""  Sherlock throws John a look.  Sherlock says: ""When I met you for the first time yesterday, I said, ""Afghanistan or Iraq?"" You looked surprised.""   John asks in the background: ""How did you know?"" Sherlock states: ""I didn't know, I saw.""  Flashback to when Sherlock and John met earlier in the day. Sherlock takes a keen look at whoever is coming through the door while doing his work with his right hand on a pipette. Time seems frozen for majority of the flashback.  Zoom into John as he comes in the room. Sherlock: ""Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military."" Back to a view of Sherlock observing John as he is entering the room with one hand on a pipette. Sherlock continues in the background: ""But your conversation as you entered the room…"" John walks into the room with Mike saying: ""Bit different from my day""  Back to the present. Sherlock continues: ""…said trained at Bart's, so Army doctor-obvious."" Flashback to John standing in Bart's laboratory. Zoom into his face as Sherlock says: ""Your face is tanned…"" Flashback to when Sherlock looks down keenly at John's hand as John is handing Sherlock his mobile phone. Sherlock continues to explain: ""…but no tan above the wrists."" Zoom into and along John's wrist. Sherlock continues: ""You've been abroad, but not sunbathing."" Back to shot of John standing in the laboratory. Continuous cuts from a still of Sherlock observing him while working to a still of John standing as Sherlock continues: ""Your limp's really bad when you walk, but you don't ask for a chair when you stand, like you've forgotten about it, so it's at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic."" Transition from the still of John standing in the laboratory to Sherlock speaking to John in the taxi in the present as Sherlock continues: ""Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq."" John says to Sherlock: ""You said I had a therapist.""  Sherlock replies: ""You've got a psychosomatic limp - of course you've got a therapist."" He pauses for a moment, looks outside the taxi window. Sherlock looks round to John and says: ""Then there's your brother."" John says: ""Hmm?"" Sherlock holds his hand out to John to get John's phone.  Flashback to Sherlock taking the mobile phone from John. Close up on the phone as Sherlock opens it up and looks at its sides. Sherlock explains: ""Your phone. It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player…"" Back to the present. Sherlock looks round to John and he continues: ""…but you're looking for a flatshare - you wouldn't waste money on this."" Sherlock gestures to the phone. "" It's a gift, then."" John has given Sherlock the phone and Sherlock turns it over and looks at it again as he says: ""Scratches. Not one, many over time."" John is looking intently at Sherlock as he continues: ""The man sitting next to me wouldn't treat his one luxury item like this, so it's had a previous owner. Next bit's easy. You know it already."" Zoom into the engraving at the back of the phone as John says in the background: ""The engraving."" The engraving says: Harry Watson, From Clara, xxx Side view of Sherlock. John is starting at Sherlock the whole time Sherlock states: ""Harry Watson: clearly a family member who's given you his old phone."" Sherlock continues: ""Not your father, this is a young man's gadget. Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live. Unlikely you've got an extended family, certainly not one you're close to, so brother it is.""  Sherlock pauses for a moment and looks at John with a look and says: ""Now, Clara..."" Zoom into the engraving at the back of the phone again. Sherlock says in the background: ""Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment."" John is still looking at Sherlock as Sherlock waves the phone around a little bit and continues: ""…The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend."" Rapid cuts from close up views of the phone to Sherlock and John in the taxi. Sherlock: ""She must have given it to him recently - this model's only six month's old."" Rapid cuts from different angled views of Sherlock speaking to John in the taxi. Sherlock continues: ""Marriage in trouble then - six months on and he's just given it away. IF she'd left him , he would have kept it. People do - sentiment. But no...""  Sherlock continues: ""...he wanted rid of it. He left her.""  Sherlock: ""...He gave the phone to you: that says he wants you to stay in touch."" John is staring at Sherlock explaining. Sherlock: ""You're looking for cheap accomodation, but you're not going to your brother for help…"" Sherlock continues: ""...that says you've got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you don't like his drinking."" John asks Sherlock: ""How, can you possibly know about the drinking?"" Sherlock smiles and says: ""Shot in the dark. Good one, though.""  Sherlock explains: ""Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it."" Close up of the microUSB port on the phone (for charging). Sherlock says in the background: ""Every night he goes to plug it in to charge…"" John looks at his phone in Sherlock's phone as Sherlock moves it around explaining: ""…but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man's phone;"" Sherlock: ""...never see a drunk's without them."" Sherlock hands the phone back and says: ""There you go, you see - you were right. John asks incredulously: ""I was right? Right about what?"" Sherlock states:""The police don't consult amateurs."" Sherlock looks out of the side window, biting his lip nervously while he awaits John's reaction.  John pauses for a moment, then says: ""That…was amazing."" He looks out his side window for a moment.  Sherlock looks round, apparently so surprised that he cannot even reply for the subsequent few seconds.  Sherlock looks round at John and asks: ""Do you think so?"" John immediately replies: ""Of course it was. It was extraordinary; it was quite extraordinary."" Sherlock says: ""That's not what people normally say"" and looks down.  Camera is on Sherlock. John asks in the background: ""What do people normally say?"" Sherlock replies: ""'Piss off!'"" He smiles briefly at John.  John grins and turns away to look out of the window as the journey continues.  The taxi passes by a clothing store with white mannequins on display.  Frontal view of a black taxi passing by. Local traffic. ",25
"The cab has arrived at Lauriston Gardens and Sherlock and John get out of the taxi and start walking. Sherlock asks John as he adjusts his coat while walking: ""Did I get anything wrong?"" John: ""Harry and me don't get on, never have. Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they're getting a divorce; and Harry is a drinker."" Sherlock (looking impressed with himself): ""Spot on, then. I didn't expect to be right about everything."" John: ""Harry's short for Harriet."" Sherlock stops dead in his tracks and says: ""Harry's your sister."" John continues walking until he realises Sherlock has stopped. John, continusing onwards, asks: ""Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here?"" Sherlock, furiously and with gritted teeth, says: ""Sister!"" and catches up with John.  John: ""No, seriously, what am I doing here?"" Sherlock, exasperated, adds: ""There's always something."" The two men continue walking. ",26
"Sherlock and John approach the police tape where they are met by Sergeant Donovan. Donovan says to Sherlock: ""Hello, freak."" Sherlock: ""I'm here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade."" Donovan asks: ""Why?"" Sherlock answers: ""I was invited."" Donovan asks again: ""Why?"" Sherlock says sarcastically: ""I think he wants me to take a look."" Donovan: ""Well, you know what I think, don't you?"" Sherlock says: ""Always, Sally"" as he lifts the yellow tape and ducks underneath it. Sherlock takes a deep breath through his nose. Sherlock: ""I even know you didn't make it home last night."" Donovan starts: ""I don't-"" then notices John and says: ""Er, who's this?"" Sherlock: ""Colleague of mine, Dr. Watson.""  He turns to John and says: ""Doctor Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan"", then sarcastically adds: ""Old friend."" Sergeant Donovan stares at Sherlock in disbelief the whole time.  Donovan mockingly says: ""Colleague? How do you get a colleague?"" Donovan turns to John, points at Sherlock and asks: ""What, did he follow you home?"" John asks: ""Would it be better if I waited and…"" ready to leave the area.  Sherlock lifts the tape for John and says: ""No."" John stops in his tracks awkwardly for a moment.  As John walks under the tape, Donovan lifts a radio to her mouth and says into the radio: ""Freak's here. Bringing him in"" then walks toward the crime scene.  Sherlock and John follow Donovan.  Sherlock looks all around the area and at the ground as they approach the building.  As Sherlock and John reach the pavement, a man dressed in blue coveralls comes out of the house. Sherlock says: ""Ah, Anderson. Here we are again."" Anderson looks at him in distaste. Short cut to John looking at the interaction between Sherlock and Anderson. Anderson says: ""It's a crime scene. I don't want it contaminated. Are we clear on that?"" Sherlock takes in another deep breath through his nose and says: ""Quite clear."" He pauses for a moment, then asks Donovan: ""Is your wife away for long?"" Donovan: ""Oh, don't pretend you worked that out. Somebody told you that."" Sherlock: ""Your deodorant told me that."" Anderson: ""My deodorant?"" Donovan is in the background looking at the two men conversing Sherlock quirkily says: ""It's for men!"" Anderson: ""Well, of course it's for men! I'm wearing it!"" Sherlock replies: ""So's sergeant Donovan.""  Anderson looks round in shock at Donovan. Sherlock sniffs pointedly.  John makes a small smirk.  Sherlock: ""Ooh, and I think it just vaporized. May I go in?"" Anderson turns back and points at Sherlock angrily and says: ""Now look: whatever you're trying to imply…"" Sherlock walks forward past Anderson saying: ""I'm not implying anything."" He heads past Donovan towards the front door and gives her a look and says: ""I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over."" John follows Sherlock.  Sherlock turns around and adds: ""And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees."" Anderson and Donovan stare at Sherlock in horror, while Sherlock smiles smugly and goes into the house.  John walks past Donovan, briefly but pointedly looking down at her knees, then follows Sherlock inside.  Shot of Sherlock entering the House.  Black Screen ",27

"Sherlock enters the house on Lauriston Gardens. John follows and Sherlock leads him into a room on the ground floor where Lestrade is putting on a coverall.  Sherlock points to some coveralls on the table and says to John: ""Wear one of these."" Lestrade is looking at John while putting on his coveralls.  Lestrade asks Sherlock: ""Who's this?"" Sherlock (taking his gloves off): ""He's with me."" Lestrade insists: ""But who is he?"" Sherlock firmly replies: ""I said he's with me."" Lestrade doesn't say more.  John has taken off his jacket and picks up a coverall.He looks at Sherlock who has picked up a pair of latex gloves. A policeman passes by. John refers to the coverall and asks Sherlock: ""Aren't you gonna put one on?""Sherlock just looks at him sternly. John shakes his head as if to say, 'Silly me, what was I thinking?' Sherlock asks Lestrade: ""So where are we?""  Lestrade (pickingup another pair of latex gloves) replies: ""Upstairs."" A top view of the spiral staircase from the 3rd floor. There is a foreboding feeling to the scene.  Lestrade leads Sherlock and John up a circular staircase. He and John are wearing coveralls together with white cotton coverings over their shoes, and latex gloves. Sherlock is putting on latex gloves as they go up the stairs. Lestrade turns round to Sherlock and John while walking up and says: ""I can give you two minutes."" Sherlock casually states: ""May need longer.""  Lestrade explains as they go up the stairs: ""Her name's Jennifer Wilson according to her credit cards. We're running them now for contact details. Hasn't been here long. Some kids found her."" They pass by many people working on the case.  Camera goes up and through the floor to the body of the dead woman Jennifer Wilson who is lying facedown in a room two storeys above ground floor. The sounds of the three men walking up the stairs could be heard.  Camera pans from the body to Lestrade, who enters the room first. The room is empty of furniture except for a rocking horse in the far cornder. Emergency portable lighting has been set up by the police. Scaffolding poles hold up part of the ceiling near where a couple of holes have been knocked through one of the walls. ",29
"Sherlock walks a few steps into the room , then stops, holding one hand out in frontof himself as he focuses on the corpse. Then John enters into the room. Lestrade has his hands behind his back and silently looks at the victim's body. The three of them, stand there silently. Behind Sherlock, John looks at the woman's body and his face fills with sadness. The three men's point of view of the woman lying on her stomach in the middle of the room facedown. She has a pink jacket on.  The three men, stand there silently for several long seconds looking at the corpse.  Close Up on Sherlock's face. Sherlock abruptly turns round to Lestrade on his right mid-thought and says: ""Shut up."" Lestrade, startled, exclaims: ""I didn't say anything!"" John looks at Sherlock as well.  Sherlock replies: ""You were thinking, it's annoying"" then goes back to looking at the corpse.  Lestrade throws a surprised look at John.  John looks back at Lestrade, also with a surprised look. He then looks back round at the corpse.  Sherlock takes two tentative steps toward the corpse until he reaches the side of the corpse. Lestrade and John stay near the door.  Sherlock keenly looks down at the corpse. Something catches his attention immediately. Scratched into the floorboards near the woman's left hand is the word ""Rache"".  Sherlock's POV. His eyes flick to her fingernails where the index and middle nails are broken and ragged at the ends. The pink nail polish is chipped in stark comparison to her other nails which are still immaculate. The woman's index finger rests at the bottom of the 'e' as if she was still trying to carve into the floor when she died.  Sherlock instantly makes a deduction: left handed. Sherlock looks back to the word carved into the floorboards An immediate suggestion springs into his mind: RACHE German (n.) revenge Sherlock shakes his head and his previous thought disappears. He looks down at the word again. Sherlock overlays the five letters with a clearer type. Next to the 'e' a rapid progression of letter appear and disappear as he tries to complete a word, then the correct letter settles into place to form the word Rachel He squats down beside the body and runs his gloved hand along the back of her coat, then lifts his hand again to look at his fingers: wet Sherlock reaches into the corpse's coat pockets.  John watches keenly Sherlock finds a white folding umbrella in one of them. Running his fingers along the folds of the material, he then inspects his glove again: dry Sherlock puts the umbrella back in her pocket.  Sherlock moves up to the collar of her coat and runs his fingers underneath it  Sherlocks looks again at his fingers: wet Lestrade stares keenly at Sherlock Reaching into his pocket, Sherlock takes out a magnifier and clicks it open Sherlock closely inspects the delivate gold bracelet on her left wrist: clean Sherlock leans a little closer to see her gold earring attached to her left ear: clean Sherlock also takes a look at the gold chain around her neck: clean Sherlock puts his magnifying glass closer toward the victim's left hand to look at her rings.  A view of the wedding ring and engagement ring flag a different message to Sherlock: dirty Sherlock blinks as a rapid succession of conclusions appear in front of his eyes Back to a view of the rings. The conclusions Sherlock draw are: married, unhappily married, unhappily married 10+ years John is keenly watching. He tilts his head left and right, wondering what Sherlock is doing.  Carefully Sherlock works the wedding ring off the woman's finger and holds it up to look at the inside of the ring.  While the outside of the ring is still showing dirty, the inside registers as, clean As Sherlock lowers the ring and slides it back onto the woman's finger, he has already reached a conclusion about the ring: regularly removed Lifting his hands away from the woman, he looks down at her and makes his final deduction about her.  A view of the woman's face on the floor. Sherlock's deduction serial adulterer appears next to her.  Sherlock smiles slightly in satisfaction.  Lestrade breaks the silence and asks: ""Got anything?""",30
"Sherlock removes his gloves and stands up and nonchalantly replies: ""Not much.""  Sherlock reaches into his coat pocket and gets his mobile phone. Someone's voice is heard saying: ""She's German."" Anderson, from where he is casually leaning against the doorway continues: ""'Rache': It's German for 'revenge'. She could be trying to tell us something…"" While he is speaking, Sherlock has walked quickly towards the door and now begins to close it in Anderson's face. Sherlock is looking at something on his phone while walking.  Sherlock, while not taking his eyes of his phone, says sarcastically: ""Yes, thank you for your input"" then slams the door shut. He turns and walks back into the room.  John looks contemplative. In the background Lestrade asks: ""So she's german?"" Sherlock while speaking has called up a menu for UK weather on his phone. The menu offers five options: Maps, Local, Warnings, Next 24 Hours, 7 Day Forecast. He selects the Maps option. Sherlock, still looking at his phone, says: ""Of course she's not. She's from out of town, though. Intended to stay in London for one night...."" Sherlock smiles smugly when he apparently finds the information he needed from his phone. He continues: ""...before returning to Cardiff"" He then pockets his phone.  John is looking a little confused, lost in his thoughts, when Sherlock says: ""So far, so obvious.""  John incredulously asks: ""Sorry - obvious?"" Lestrade asks: ""What about the message, though?"" Sherlock ignores Lestrade, looks at John and asks: ""Doctor Watson, what do you think?"" John looks round at Lestrade, then at Sherlock and asks: ""Of the message?""",31
"Sherlock: ""Of the body. You're a medical man."" Lestrade interjects: ""Wait, no, we have a whole team right outside."" Sherlock replies: ""They won't work with me."" Cut to John awkwardly staying silent during the conversation between Sherlock and Lestrade Lestrade says: ""I'm breaking every rule letting you in here."" Sherlock states confidently: ""Yes…because you need me.""  John quickly turns round to Lestrade to see his reaction Lestrade stares at him for a moment with his mouth ready to defend himself, then he lowers his eyes helplessly and says: ""Yes, I do. God help me."" Sherlock says: ""Doctor Watson."" John looks up from the body to Sherlock and says: ""Hm?"" Then he turns his head towards Lestrade, silently seeking his permission.  Lestrade, a little tetchily, says: ""Oh, do as he says. Help yourself"" He turns and opens the door, going outside.  Lestrade says in the background: ""Anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes"" as John and Sherlock approach the corpse on each of her sides and squat down. John painfully lowers himself to one knee on the other side, learning heavily on his cane to support himself.  Sherlock looks toward John and asks: ""Well?"" John asks softly: ""What am I doing here?"" Sherlock whispers: ""Helping me make a point."" John softly replies: ""I'm supposed to be helping you pay the rent."" Sherlock replies softly: ""Yeah well, this is more fun."" John asks: ""Fun? There's a woman lying dead."" Sherlock admits: ""Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you'd go deeper."" Lestrade comes back into the room and stands just inside the doorway John drags his other leg down into a kneeling position and then leans forward to look more closely at the woman's body. Sherlock and Lestrade are watching. John puts his head close to the woman's and sniffs. He then straightens a little.  Sherlock and Lestrade are paying close attention to John.  John lifts her right hand and looks at her skin.  Sherlock and Lestrade are keenly watching.  John looks closely at the woman's skin on her right hand.  John says: ""Yup."" John kneels up and looks across to Sherlock. John continues: ""Asphyxiation, probably."" Sherlock looks round to Lestrade, while John says: "" Passed out, choked on her own vonmit.""  John looks up at Sherlock and says: ""Can't smell any alcohol on her. It could have been a seizure; possibly drugs."" Sherlock, looking at John, states: ""You know what it was, you've read the papers."" John looks surprised and says: ""What, she's one of the suicides? The fourth…?"" Camera is fixed on Sherlock. Lestrade says: ""Sherlock - two minutes, I said. I need anything you've got.""",32
"Sherlock stands up, while John is struggling to get on his feet, and says: ""Victim is in her late thirties. Professional person, going by her clothes. I'm guessing something in the media, going by the…"" Cut to a view of the woman dressed in pink on the floor. Sherlock (in the background): ""…frankly alarming shade of pink.""  Sherlock continues in the background as John looks at the body, then at Sherlock walking across the room saying: ""Travelled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night."" Sherlock walks past Lestrade and says: ""It's obvious from the size of her suitcase."" Sherlock looks around the room.  Lestrade: ""Suitcase?"" Sherlock continues to look around the room and says: ""Suitcase, yes. She's been married at least ten years, but not happily. She's had a string of lovers, but none of them knew she was married."" Lestrade has his arms crossed: "" Oh, for God's sake, if you're just making this up…"" Sherlock points down to her left hand and bends down near her explaining: ""Her wedding ring. Ten years old at least. The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring…""  Lestrade looks shocked as Sherlock continues in the background: ""State of her marriage right there…"" Sherlock is squatting down beneath the woman's body and he continues to explain: ""The inside of the ring is shinier than the outside - that means it's regularly removed. The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger."" Sherlock: ""It's not for work; look at her nails."" Sherlock looks down.  A view of Jennifer Wilson's hand with pink nail polish. Sherlock continues: ""She doesn't work with her hands.""  John looks at Sherlock in shock as Sherlock gets up and continues: ""…so what or rather whom does she remove her rings for?"" Sherlock: ""Clearly not one lover; she'd never sustain the fiction of being single over that amount of time, so more likely a string of them. Simple."" John admiringly says to Sherlock: ""That's brilliant."" Sherlock looks round at him and John immediately says: ""Sorry.""  Lestrade asks: ""Cardiff?"" Sherlock says: ""It's obvious, isn't it?"" John: ""It's not obvious to me."" and stares at Sherlock.  Sherlock pauses as he looks at the other two men and says seriously: ""Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring."" Sherlock turns back to the body and explains in a lively manner: ""Her coat: it's slightly damp. She's been in heavy rain in the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London in that time."" Sherlock continues, looking at Lestrade: ""Under her coat collar is damp, too. She's turned it up against the wind. She's got an umbrella in her left-hand pocket but it's dry and unused: not just wind, strong wind - too strong to use her umbrella. We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight, so sht must have come a decent distance but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried."" Sherlock reaches into his coat pocket and continues : ""…So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time?""  Sherlock shows the other two the webpage he was looking at earlier, displaying the day's weather for the Southern part of Britain. Sherlock states: ""Cardiff."" John exclaims: ""That's fantastic!"" Sherlock turns round to John and speaks in a low voice: ""D'you know you do that out loud?"" John apologetically says: ""Sorry, I'll shut up.""  Sherlock replies in a low voice: ""No it's….fine"" Lestrade asks at the back: ""Why do you keep saying suitcase?"" Sherlock spins around in a circle to look around the room. Sherlock: ""Yes, where is it? She must have had a phone or an organiser. Find out who Rachel is."" Lestrade asks: ""She was writing 'Rachel'?"" Sherlock sarcastically says to Lestrade: ""No, she was leaving an angry note in German!"" Sherlock: ""Of course she was writing Rachel"" John looks stunned at Sherlock's deduction. Sherlock goes back near the body and looks down at it as he says: ""...no other word it can be. Question is: why did she wait until she was dying to write it?"" Lestrade asks: ""How'd you know she had a suitcase?"" There is a policeman outside of the room.  Sherlock points down to the body, where her tights have small black splotches on the lower part of her right leg. He explains: ""Back of the right leg: tiny splash marks on the hell and calf, not present on the left…"" Close up to the victim's legs where Sherlock was pointing to earlier. Sherlock continues in the background: ""She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand.."" Mud marks are seen on her right leg. Sherlock points as he explains: ""Don't get that splash pattern any other way."" John and Lestrade are watching intently.  Sherlock looks toward Lestrade: ""Smallish case, going by the spread."" Sherlock: ""Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious: could only be an overnight bag, so we know she was staying one night."" Lestrade and John keep silent, standing up with their arms crossed while thinking.  Sherlock squats down by the woman's body and examines the back of her legs more closely. Sherlock asks: ""Now, where is it? What have you done with it?"" Lestrade shakes his head and says: ""There wasn't a case."" John looks at him, surprised.  Slowly Sherlock raises his head and frowns up at Lestrade. He says: ""Say that again.""",33
"Lestrade says: ""There wasn't a case. There was never any suitcase."" Sherlock registers this fact.  Immediately Sherlock straightens up and heads for the door, calling out to all police officers in the house as he begins to hurry down the stairs. Sherlock: ""Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase? Was there a suitcase in this house?"" He passes by Lestrade, John as well as a policeman guarding the door.  Lestrade comes out of the room, passes the police standing guard, and calls down the stairs: ""Sherlock, there was no case!"" Sherlock, slowing down, but still making his way down the stairs, says: ""But they take the poison themselves; they chew, swallow the pills themselves. There are clear signs. Even you lot couldn't miss them"" Lestrade: ""Right, yeah, thanks!"" He callls out loudly down the stairs: ""AND…?"" John stays silent beside Lestrade. The two stay upstairs.  Sherlock reaches a floor where Anderson and two other people dressed in coveralls as well as another policeman are patiently waiting. Sherlock calls up the stairs to answer Lestrade: ""It's murder, all of them. I don't know how, but they're not suicides, they're killings..."" View of Lestrade and John looking down at the stair railings. Sherlock continues: ""…serial killings."" Sherlock abruptly holds his hands in front of his face in delight. Sherlock says joyfully: ""We've got ourselves a serial killer. I love those. There's always something to look forward to."" Sherlock continues down the next flight of stairs quickly. He passes by another policeman standing guard by another door on that floor.  Lestrade calls down the stairs: ""Why are you saying that?"" John stays silent.  Sherlock stops going down the stairs and calls up to the others: ""Her case! Come on, where is her case? Did she eat it?"" Another view of Lestrade and John staring intently down the stairs at Sherlock who continues: ""Someone else was here, and they took her case."" Sherlock, more quietly as if talking to himself, says: ""So the killer must have driven here; forgot the case was in the car…"" John from the top of the stairs calls down to Sherlock :""She could have checked into a hotel, left her case there."" Sherlock looks up the stairs again and calls up to John: ""No, she never got to the hotel. Look at her hair. She colour-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes. She'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking…"" Sherlock then stops talking as he makes a realisation. Sherlock says: ""Oh."" His eyes widen and his face lights up. He exclaims: ""Oh!"" He then claps his hands together in delight. John from the top of the stairs says: ""Sherlock?"" Lestrade leans over the railings and asks: ""What is it, what?"" Sherlock, smiling cheerfully to himself, says: ""Serial killers are always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake."" Lestrade leans against the railings and exclaims: ""We can't just wait!"" Sherlock says looking up: ""Oh we're done waiting."" He starts to hurry down the stairs again. He then continues: ""Look at her, really look! Houston, we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff: find out who Jennifer Wilson's family and friends are. Find Rachel!"" Sherlock reaches the bottom of the stairs and disappears from view.  Lestrade, calling after Sherlock, says: ""Of course, yeah - But what mistake?!"" Sherlock comes back into view and runs up a couple of stairs so that he can be seen before he stops and yells up to Lestrade: ""PINK!"" He then leaves the building.  Back to a view of the stunned faces of Lestrade and John at the top of the stairs. Anderson goes by and says: ""Let's get on with it.""  More people in coveralls and a man in a suit come up the stairs to get the investigation going.  Lestrade goes back into the crime scene, while John is remaining standing outside awkwardly out of place.  Forgotten by everyone else, John hesitates on the landing for a moment and then slowly starts making his way down the stairs.  While going down the stairs, a couple more police officers hurry up and one of them bumps against him, throwing him off-balance and making him lurch heavily against the bannisters. The man hurries on without a word, although his colleague does at least look apologeticaly at John as he passes.  John gets out of the building. He has removed his coveralls and put his jacket back on, and now walks onto the street. There are many police officers and people around the building. Looking all around, he can see no sign of Sherlock. ",34
"John walks toward the police tape, still looking around. Donovan is at the police tape speaking with a police man.  Donovan, standing at the tape alongside a police man, sees him and says: ""He's gone."" John asks Donovan: ""Sherlock Holmes?"" Donovan: ""Yeah, he just took off. He does that."" John asks Donovan: ""Is he coming back?"" Donovan: ""Didn't look like it."" John: ""Right."" He looks around the area again thoughtfully, unsure of what to do. John says quietly: ""Right….yes."" Donovan has gone back to talking with the police man near the tape.  John turns to Donovan again and asks: ""Sorry, where am I?"" Donovan turns around and answers: ""Brixton.""  John asks Donovan: ""Right. Er, d'you know where I could get a cab? It's just, er… well…"" H e looks down awkwardly at his walking stick and says: ""…my leg."" Donovan: ""Er…"" She stepss over to the tape and lifts it for him and says: ""…try the main road."" John says: ""Thanks"" and ducks under the tape.  Donovan says: ""But you're not his friend."" John stops in his tracks Donovan: ""He doesn't have any friends."" John then turns back towards her. Donovan continues: ""So who are you?"" John replies: ""I'm…I'm nobody. I just met him. "" Donovan: ""Okay, bit of advice then: stay away from that guy."" John asks: ""Why?"" Donovan doesn't answer right away.  Donovan: ""You know why he's here?"" John doesn't answer, he has an unknowing look.  Donovan continues: ""He's not paid or anything. He likes it. He gets off on it. The weirder the crime, the more he gets off. And you know what? One day just showing up won't be enough. One day we'll be standing round a body and Sherlock Holmes will be the one that put it there.""  John: ""Why would he do that?"" Donovan: ""Because he's a psychopath."" She nods while speaking.  John doesn't know what to say. Donovan continues in the background: ""Psychopaths get bored."" Lestrade calls out to Donovan near the entrace to the house: ""Donovan!"" Donovan turns and calls to him: ""Coming!"" John is still standing near the tape. Expressionless. He looks at Donovan who is making her way inside the house.  Donovan turns around toward John and calls out to John: ""Stay away from Sherlock Holmes"" John watches her go, then looks around for a moment.  John turns and eyes the distance he has to go to get to the main road.  John begins to limp down the road. He is looking up toward his left.",35
"The sound of a telephone ringing is heard and John stops walking.  John turns to where the sound is coming from. It is from a public telephone in a red booth. He looks at it for a few seconds.  John looks down at his watch, shakes his head and continues down the road.  A view of the telephone booth. It stops ringing as John starts walking away.  Not long afterwards, John is walking down the main road. He tries to hail a passing taxi. John yells out: ""Taxi! Taxi…"" The taxi passes him by In Chicken Cottage, the fast food restaurant outside which John is stand, the payphone on the wall begins to ring. John turns and looks as one of the serving staff walks over to it but as he reaches for the phone, it stops.  John stares at the phone from the outside for a moment then resumes walking.  John is walking on down the road and shortly afterwards approaches another public telephone box. The phone inside starts to ring.  John stops. Mystified by this, he looks left and right to see if anyone else is going to pick up. John reaches for the telephone booth door and goes into the telephone box.  John lifts the phone, puts it to his ear and says: ""Hello?"" A man's voice speaks down on the phone. The man says: ""There is a security camera on the building to your left. Do you see it?"" John does not turn his head. He frowns. John: ""Who's this?"" There is no answer. John asks again: ""Who's speaking?"" Camera's point of view of John in the phone box. The man says: ""Do you see the camera, Doctor Watson?"" The camera zooms in. John is looking through the window of the phone box. A shot of the CCTV camera high up on the wall of a nearby building John replies: ""Yeah, I see it.""  The Man says: ""Watch."" The camera, which was pointing directly at the phone box, now swivels away. John is no longer visible through the camera.  The screen is split into four. Supposedly four cameras (Brixton 053, Brixton 002, Brixton 051, Brixton 047) that show what is going on on the street. Brixton 051, the camera that has just swivelled, now shows a close up of the road. Nothing else is visible. Brixton 053 and Brixton 047 are still showing John in the phone booth at different angles.  The man says: ""There's another camera on the building opposite to you."" John looks around to find it.  A shot of the other CCTV camera. The man's voice continues: ""Do you see it?"" John does not answer, but he is looking in the camera's direction.  The camera immediately swivels away.  The man: ""And finally, at the top of the buliding on your right."" John turns his head to find the camera.  Camera's point of view of John staring up into the third camera.  John's viewpoint of the camera as it turns away.  The screen is split into four. Now camera Brixton 053, 051 and 047, which were initially trained on the phone box's direction are showing nothing.  John asks into the phone: ""How are you doing this?"" The man's voice says: ""Get into the car, Doctor Watson."" A black car pulls up at the kerbside near the phone. John watches it pull up.  The man continues: ""I would make some sort of threat, but I'm sure your situation is quite clear to you.""  The male driver gets out and opens the rear car door. The phone goes dead. John puts the phone down and looks thoughtful for a moment, then turns to leave the phone box. ",36
"A few moments later John is sitting in the back seat of the car as it pulls away and drives off.  John is on the right seat, right behind the driver. An attractive young woman is sitting beside John, her eyes fixed on her BlackBerry while she types on it. She is ignoring him. John turns toward her and says: ""Hello."" The woman smiles brightly at him for a moment and says: ""hi"", before returning her gaze to her phone. John awkwardly stays seated.  John turns to the woman and asks: ""What's your name, then?"" The woman, without looking up from her phone, replies: ""Er…Anthea."" John asks Anthea: ""Is that your real name?"" Anthea smiles, turns toward John, and says: ""No."" John nods, then twists to look out of the rear window briefly before turning back again.  John says: ""I'm John"" while looking straight ahead.  Anthea, still with eyes locked on her phone, replies: ""Yes. I know.""  John, surprised, looks at Anthea for a moment, then turns back.  John looks straight at the road and asks: ""Any point in asking where I am going?"" Anthea turns and smiles briefly at him and says: ""None at all…"" then looks back at her phone again. She continues: ""…John."" John turns to look out his window on the right and says: ""Okay."" Some time later, the car pulls into an almost-empty warehouse. ",37
"A man in a suit is standing in the centre of the area, leaning nonchalantly on an umbrella as he watches the car stop and John get out. Only his backside is shown. The car's lights are still on, illuminating the place.  The Man, whose face is not yet shown, watches John limps towards him, leaning heavily on his cane.  In front of the man is a straight-backed armless chair facing him. He gestures to it with the point of his umbrella and says: ""Have a seat, John."" His face is visible.  As John continues to limp toward the man; his voice is calm as he says: ""You know, I've got a phone."" He looks around the warehouse. John continues: ""I mean, very clever and all that but er….you could just phone me. On my phone."" He walks straight past the chair and stops a few paces in front of the man.  The Man: ""When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes, one learns to be discreet, hence this place."" The  The Man gestures to the warehouse. He continues: ""The leg must be hurting you."" The Man's voice, which has had a pleasant smile in it so far, now becomes a little more stern. He says: ""Sit Down."" John looks straight at the Man and says: ""I don't want to sit down.""  The Man looks at him curiously and says: ""You don't seem very afraid."" John says: ""You don't seem very frightening."" The Man chuckles and says: ""Ah, yes. The bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity…"" John looks back at the Man with a straight face as the Man continues: ""…don't you think?"" The Man looks at John sternly and asks: ""What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?"" John replies: ""I don't have one. I barely know him. I met him…"" He looks away thoughtfully, then appears surprised as if he hadn't realised until now how little time has passed. He continues: ""…yesterday."" The Man: ""Mmm, and since yesterday you've moved in with him and now you're solving crimes together. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?"" John asks: ""Who are you?"" The Man replies: ""An interested party."" John asks: ""Interested in Sherlock, why?"" John continues: ""I'm guessing you're not friends."" The Man: ""You've met him. How many 'friends' do you imagine he has?"" John recognises the truth in the Man's words and does not reply.  The Man: ""I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having."" John asks: ""And what's that?"" The Man replies: ""An enemy."" John immediately says: ""An enemy?"" The Man: ""In his mind, certainly."" The Man continues: ""If you were to ask him, he'd probably say his arch-enemy. He does love to be dramatic."" John says sarcastically: ""Well, thank God you're above all that."" The Man frowns at John.  John's phone trills a text alert and John reaches into his left pocket.  John takes his phone out and activates it, looking at the message while ignoring the man in front of him. The message reads: Baker Street. Come at once if convenient. SH The Man says: ""I hope I'm not distracting you."" John continues to look at his phone and does not answer right away.  John, finally looking up from his phone, casually says: ""Not distracting me at all"" The Man asks: ""Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?"" John replies: ""I could be wrong… but I think that's none of your business."" The Man, a little ominously, replies: ""It could be."" John says with a stern look: ""It really couldn't."" The Man takes a notebook from his inside pocket, then opens it and consults it as he says: ""If you do move into um…"" The Man reads aloud from his notebook and says: ""Two hundred and twenty one B…"" John is looks down at the Man's notebook. The Man continues: ""…Baker Street, I'd be happy to pay you a meaningful…"" The Man continues: ""…sum of money on a regular basis to…"" He closes his notebook and puts it away again, then continues: ""…ease your way."" John asks: ""Why?""   The Man replies in a matter-of-fact way: ""Because you're not a wealthy man."" John: ""In exchange for what?"" The Man pauses for a moment and says: ""Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you'd feel…uncomfortable with."" The Man continues: ""Just tell me what he's up to.""  John asks: ""Why?"" The Man replies: ""I worry about him…constantly."" Johns says insincerely: ""That's nice of you."" The Man: ""But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned. We have what you might call a…"" The man looks at the tip of his umbrella for a moment, then says: ""... difficult relationship.""  John's phone trills another text alert. ",38
"John immediately takes his phone out  John looks at the message, which reads: If inconvenient, come anyway. SH John closes the message and says: ""No"" in response to the Man's offer.  The Man: ""But I haven't mentioned a figure."" John says: ""Don't bother."" The Man laughs briefly and says: ""You're very loyal, very quickly."" John says: ""No, I'm not. I'm just not interested.""  The Man looks at him closely for a moment, then takes out his notebook and opens it again. The Man gestures slightly to make it clear that he is reading a note from the book and says: ""'Trust issues,' it says here."" For the first time since the encounter with The Man, John looks a little unnerved. He looks down at the notebook in The Man's hand and asks: ""What's that?"" The Man, still looking down at his book, asks: ""Could it be that you've decided to trust Sherlock Holmes…."" The Man continues: ""…of all people?"" John is still looking down at the notebook.  John asks: ""Who says I trust him?"" and looks up at The Man.  The Man, still looking down at his book, says: ""You don't seem the kind to make friends easily."" John, starting to get angry, asks: ""Are we done?"" The man raises his head and looks into John eyes. He says: ""You tell me."" John looks at The Man for a few seconds, tilting his head.  John turns around to go back to the car.  John turns his back on The Man and starts to walk away.   John continues to walk back toward the car. The Man says: ""I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him, but I can see from your left hand that's not going to happen."" John stops walking.  John pauses, shakes his head, then turns around to face The Man again. He asks through bared teeth: ""My what?"" The Man says calmly: ""Show me."" He nods toward John's left hand as he speaks. He plants the tip of his umbrella on the floor and leans on it casually. ",39
"John pauses, then deliberately shifts his feet under him, as if digging in. He raises his left hand, bending it at the elbow, and stands still. He wants The Man to come to him to see his hand.  Unperturbed by John's beligerence, the man strolls forward, hooking the handle of the umbrella over his arm as he reaches for John's hand. The Man reaches for John's hand. John instantly pulls his hand back a little and says tensely: ""Don't"" The Man lowers his head and raises his eyebrows at John with a small smile John stares at The Man for a moment. John very reluctantly lowers his hand, holding it out flat with the palm down. The man takes it in both of his own hands.  The Man examines John's hand closely then states: ""Remarkable."" John snatches his hand away and asks: ""What is?"" The Man turns and while walking a few paces away says: ""Most people blunder round this city, and all they see are streets and shops and cars."" John is staring at The Man.  The Man stops walking and continues: ""When you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield."" John is looking at The Man with a serious look the whole time.  The Man turns toward John again and asks: ""You've seen it already, haven't you?"" John asks: ""What's wrong with my hand?"" The Man says: ""You have an intermittent tremor in…"" The Man continues: ""…your left hand."" John nods in agreement.  The Man: ""Your therapist thinks it's post-traumatic…"" The Man continues: ""…stress disorder. She thinks you're haunted by memories of your military service."" John almost flinches as the man accurately fires off these facts at him. His gaze is fixed ahead of him and a muscle in his cheek twitches repeatedly. John, angry and distressed, asks: ""Who the hell are you?"" The Man does not answer.  John asks: ""How do you know that?"" The Man ignores John's questions and says: ""Fire her. She's got it the wrong way around."" The Man continues: ""You're under stress right now and your hand is perfectly steady."" John's eyes flicker downwards before returning to stare ahead of himself, his face set and struggling to hold back his anger.  The Man: ""You're not haunted by the war, Doctor Watson….you miss it."" The Man leans closer to John. Reluctantly, John's eyes rise up to meet his.  The Man whispers: ""Welcome back."" The Man turns to walk away.  John looks straight ahead and looks angry, but defeated.  The Man is walking away toward John's right, while casually twirling his umbrella as he goes. Just then, John receives another text message alert. John continues to look straight ahead.  The Man says while walking away: ""Time to choose a side, Doctor Watson."" John turns his head toward The Man and glances at him for a moment, then looks straight ahead once again.  Behind John, the car door opens. Anthea gets out and walks a few paces towards John, her attention still fixed on the BlackBerry held in front of her in both hands. ",40
"John half turns toward Anthea at the sound of her footsteps. Anthea says: ""I'm to take you home."" John stops and takes out his phone from his left pocket to look at the new message. It reads: Could be dangerous. SH. John puts the phone back in his left pocket.  John holds out his left hand in front of him and studies the lack of tremor coming from it. He smiles wryly.  Anthea asks: ""Address?"" John turns toward her.  John replies: ""Er, Baker Street."" John starts walking toward Anthea and specifies: ""Two two one B Baker Street."" John walks toward the car while saying: ""But I need to stop off somewhere first."" Later, John opens the door to his bedsit, walks in, switches on the light, and closes the door behind him. ",41
"John walks toward his desk, looking around to his right.  John opens his desk drawer.  John takes out his pistol from the drawer. John checks the clip of the gun.  John tucks the gun into the back of his waistband of his jeans and turns to leave again. ",42
"Later, the car pulls up outside of 221B Baker Street.  Inside the car, Anthea is still fixated on her phone. John looks across the her and says: ""Listen, your boss - any chance you could not tell him this is where I went?"" Anthea nonchalantly says: ""Sure."" John: ""You've told him already, haven't you?"" Anthea smiles across to him briefly then says: ""Yeah."" John nods in resignation.  John turns to get out of the car, but just as he opens the door, he turns back to her and asks: ""Hey, um… do you ever get any free time?"" Anthea smiles while typing on her phone, and sarcastically says: ""Oh yeah, lots."" John smiles and looks at her, waiting expectantly. She continues working on her phone for a long moment.  Anthea turns and looks at him before allowing her gaze to drift past him to the door of 221B. She says: ""Bye."" Indicating that John should leave.  John says: ""Okay"" then he gets out of the car.  John gets out of the car onto the street.   The car drives away and John walks across the pavement to the front door of 221 B.  John knocks on the door. ",43
"Side panning view of Sherlock. Upstairs in the living room of the flat, Sherlock is lying stretched out on the sofa with his head towards the window and resting on a cushion. His jacket is off and his shirt sleeves are unbuttoned and pushes up his arms. He has his eyes closed and he is pressing the palm of his right hand firmly onto the underside of his left arm, just below the elbow.  After a few seconds, his eyes snap open wide and stares fixedly up towards the ceiling. Then he sighs out a noisy breath and relaxes.  John comes into the living room and asks: ""What are you doing?"" Sherlock replies calmly: ""Nicotine patch.""  Sherlock lifts his right hand to show that he has three round nicotine patches stuck to his arm. He says: ""Helps me think."" Sherlock continues: ""Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days. Bad news for brain work."" John, walking further into the room, says: ""It's good news for breathing."" Sherlock says dismissively: ""Ugh, breathing. Breathing's boring."" John frowns as he looks closer at Sherlock's arm and starts to walk closer to Sherlock.  John walks closer to Sherlock and asks: ""Is that three patches?"" Sherlock remains on the sofa lying down.  Sherlock presses his hands together in a prayerful position under his chin and replies: ""It's a three patch problem."" Sherlock closes his eyes. John is standing by his head. John stares at Sherlock for a second.  John looks around the room for a moment, then looks out the window for a second.  John looks down at Sherlock again. He asks: ""Well?""",44
"Sherlock does not respond and remains on the sofa with his eyes closed.  John says: ""You asked me to come, I'm assuming it's important."" Sherlock doesn't respond instantly. After a couple of seconds, his eyes snap open. He doesn't bother turning his head to look at John and asks: ""Oh, yeah, of course. Can I borrow your phone?"" John asks: ""My phone?"" Sherlock, still with his hands together, replies: ""Don't wanna use mine. Always a chance that the number will be recognised. It's on the website."" John turns his head toward the door and says: ""Mrs. Hudson's got a phone."" Sherlock: ""Yeah, she's downstairs. I tried shouting but she didn't hear."" John, beginning to get angry, says: ""I was on the other side of London!"" Sherlock says calmly: ""There was no hurry."" John glares at Sherlock and sighs. John reaches into his pocket while staring at Sherlock lying down peacefully. John holds the phone out to Sherlock and says: ""Here."" Without opening his eyes, Sherlock holds out his right hand, palm up. John slaps the phone into his hand.  John glowers at him for a moment and turns and walks a few paces away.  Sherlock has lifted his arm and put his hands together again, so that he now has the phone between his palms. John asks: ""So what's this about - the case?"" Sherlock says softly: ""Her case."" John turns around and asks: ""Her case?"" He is standing in front of the fireplace. Sherlock opens his eyes and says: ""Her suitcase, yes, obviously. The murderer took her suitcase. First big mistake."" John: ""Okay, he took her case. So?"" Sherlock say quietly, as if to himself: ""It's no use, there's no other way. We'll have to risk it."" John is standing, looking at Sherlock.  Sherlock imperiously holds out the phone to John without looking at him and orders: ""On my desk, there's a number. I want you to send a text."" John half-smiles in disbelief. John says, with a restrained angry voice: ""You brought me here…to send a text."" Sherlock, oblivious to his anger, replies: ""Text, yes. The number on my desk."" Sherlock continues to hold the phone out to John.  John continues to glower at him and stretches his neck.  John stomps across the room and snatches the phone from Sherlock's hand.  Sherlock refolds his hands under his chin and closes his eyes and breathes out a sigh.  Instead of walking to the table, John walks over to the window and looks out of it into the streets below.  Sherlock opens his eyes and tilts his head slightly toward John's direction and asks: ""What's wrong?""",45
"John replies while looking out of the window: ""Just met a friend of yours."" Sherlock frowns in confusion and asks: ""A friend?"" John replies: ""An enemy.""  Sherlock, unfazed by John's answer, visibly relaxes and asks: ""Oh. Which one?"" John pauses for a moment, surprised by Sherlock's reaction.  John says: ""Your arch-enemy according to him."" He turns toward Sherlock and asks: ""Do people have arch-enemies?"" Sherlock looks towards John, narrowing his eyes suspiciously. Sherlock asks: ""Did he offer you money to spy on me?"" John looks at Sherlock and says: ""Yes.""  Sherlock asks: ""Did you take it?""  John says: ""No."" Sherlock looks toward John and says: ""Pity. We could have split the fee. Think it through next time."" John asks: ""Who is he?"" Sherlock says softly: ""The most dangerous man you've ever met, and not my problem right now."" Sherlock, with more strength in his voice says: ""On my desk, the number.""",46
"John shoots him a dark look then turns to walk toward the desk.  John walks to the desk, activates his phone, and picks up a piece of paper taken from a luggage label. Sherlock still has his hands together and eyes closed.  John looks at the name on the paper and says: ""Jennifer Wilson. That was… Hang on."" John looks at Sherlock and asks: ""Wasn't that the dead woman?"" Sherlock says: ""Yes. That's not important. Just enter the number."" Shaking his head, John starts punching in the number into his phone.  Sherlock asks: ""Are you doing it?"" with his eyes closed.  John replies: ""Yes."" Sherlock immediately asks: ""Have you done it?"" John, frustrated, exclaims: ""Ye… hang on!"" He shakes his head.  Sherlock orders: ""These words exactly: 'What happened...'"" John starts to type as Sherlock continues: ""'…at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out.'"" John briefly looks across to Sherlock, as if concerned at what he just said. Sherlock continues: ""'Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Please come.'"" John has gone as far as typing: What happened at Lauriston Gdns? I must have b John frowns and looks across to Sherlock and asks: ""You blacked out?"" Sherlock says: ""What? No. No!"" He starts to get up from the sofa.  Sherlock flips his legs around and stands up, walks over the coffee table and says: ""Type and send it. Quickly."" John continues typing into the phone: What happened at Lauriston Gdns? I must have blacked out Going into the Kitchen, Sherlock picks up a small pink suitcase from a chair and brings it back into the living room.  Sherlock asks John: ""Have you sent it?"" He walks over to the dining table. John is still typing on the phone. John asks: ""What's the address?"" Sherlock lifts one of the dining chairs. Sherlock impatiently says: ""Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Hurry up!"" Sherlock flips the dining chair around, setting it down in front of one of the two armchairs near the fireplace. He puts the suitcase onto the dining chair and sits down in the armchair. John finishes the message: What happened at Lauriston Gdns? I must have blacked out. 22 Northumberland St. Please come.  Sherlock unzips the case and flips open the lid, revealing the contents. There are a few items of clothing and underwear - all in pink - a washbag and a paperback novel by Paul Bunch entitled ""Come to Bed Eyes."" John turns toward the case and he staggers backward slightly in shock when he realises what he's looking at. ",47
"John says: ""That's…that's the pink lady's case. That's Jennifer Wilson's case."" He continues to move backward in shock.  Sherlock confirms: ""Yes, obviously."" He looks at the case closely. John continues to stare. Sherlock looks up at him, rolls his eyes and says sarcastically: ""Oh, perhaps I should mention: I didn't kill her."" John: ""I never said you did."" Sherlock looks up at John and says: ""Why not? Given the text I just hd you send and the fact that I have her case, it's a pefectly logical assumption."" John asks: ""Do people usually assume you're the murderer?"" Sherlock smirks and replies: ""Now and then, yes."" He puts his hands onto the arms of the armchair and lifts his feet up and under him so that he is perching on the seat with his backside braced against the back rest. John looks at Sherlock warily and says: ""Okay…"" John limps across the room and asks: ""How did you get this?"" Sherlock clasps his hands under his chin. Sherlock says: ""By looking."" John drops heavily into the armchair on the other side of the fireplace as he asks: ""Where?"" Sherlock explains: ""The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens."" Sherlock is still perched on the backside of his chair.  Sherlock continues: ""He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car."" John stares at the case while Sherlock explains: ""Nobody can be seen with this case without…"" Sherlock: ""…drawing attention - particularly a man, which is statistically more likely - so obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he noticed he still had it. Wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake…"" Sherlock continues: ""I checked every back street wide enough…"" while John looks at Sherlock then intently back at the case.  Sherlock: ""…for a car five minutes away from Lauriston Gardens…"" Flashback of Sherlock standing on the edge of a rooftop looking down into the streets below as he searches for a glimpse of anywhere the case might have been hidden. Sherlock narrates: ""…and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed."" Flashback of Sherlock back on the ground and rooting through a large skip (garbage bin) in the alley before finding the case buried under black plastic, then checking the luggage label attached to the handle. Sherlock narrates: ""Took me less than an hour to find the right skip."" Back to the present. John incredulously says: ""Pink. You got all that because you realised the case would be pink?"" Sherlock says: ""Well, it had to be pink, obviously."" John, to himself, says aloud: ""Why didn't I think of that?"" Sherlock states: ""Because you're an idiot."" John looks up at him, startled. Sherlock makes a placatory gesture with his right hand and quickly adds: ""No, no, no, don't look like that. Practically everyone is."" Sherlock refolds his hands and says to John: ""Now look…"" John turns from looking at Sherlock to looking at the case.  Sherlock points at the case with his index fingers and asks: ""Do you see what's missing?""",48
"John replies: ""From the case? How could I?"" Sherlock smiles and says: ""Her phone. Where's her mobile phone? There was no phone on the body, there's no phone in the case. We know she had one - that's her number there; you just texted it."" John suggests: ""Maybe she left it at home."" Sherlock puts his hands down onto the arms of the chair, then lowers his feet to sit down properly on the chair. He explains: ""She has a string of lovers and she's careful about it. She never leaves her phone at home."" He puts the slip of paper back into the luggage label on the case and looks at John expectantly. John says: ""Er…."" thoughtfully. He looks down at his mobile phone on the arm of his chair and asks: ""Why did I just send that text?"" Sherlock says: ""Well, the question is: where is her phone now?"" John proposes: ""She could have lost it."" Sherlock says: ""Yes. Or…"" John thinks for a moment. John slowly says: ""The murderer…you think the murderer has the phone?"" Sherlock proposes: ""Maybe she left it when she left her case. Maybe he took it from her…"" John nods in agreement as Sherlock continues: ""..for some reason."" Sherlock: ""Either way, the balance of probability is…"" John has a shocked look on his face as Sherlock continues: ""…the murderer has her phone."" John interrupts and says: ""Sorry, what are we doing? Did I just text a murderer?! What good will that do?"" As if on cue, John's phone begins to ring. Sherlock and John both look at the phone.  John picks up his phone and looks at the screen for the Caller ID which reads: (withheld) calling. John looks to Sherlock as the phone continues to ring.  John looks at Sherlock as Sherlock says: ""A few hours after his last victim, and now he receives a text…"" Sherlock explains as the phone continues to ring: ""…that can only be from her. If somebody had just found that phone they'd ignore a text like that, but the murderer…."" ",49
"Sherlock pauses dramatically for a moment until the phone stops ringing. He finishes: ""...would panic."" He abruptly flips the lid of the suitcase.  Sherlock stands up and walks across the room to pick up his jacket. As John continues to stare down at his phone, Sherlock puts on his jacket and walks toward the door. John finally looks up. John asks Sherlock: ""Have you talked to the police?"" Sherlock turns around toward John.  Sherlock answers: ""Four people are dead. There isn't time to talk to the police."" He adjusts his jacket.  John asks: ""So why are you talking to me?"" Sherlock reaches behind the door. Sherlock answers: ""Mrs. Hudson took my skull."" Sherlock takes his greatcoat from the hook.  John looks toward the fireplace and notices that something is missing from the mantelpiece. He asks: ""So I'm basically filling in for your skull?"" Sherlock, putting on his coat, says: ""Relax, you're doing fine."" John doesn't move. Sherlock asks: ""Well?""  John, apparently a little bummed out, asks: ""Well what?"" Sherlock finishes putting on his coat as he says: ""Well, you could just sit there and watch telly."" John turns toward Sherlock and asks: ""What, you want me to come with you?"" Sherlock is organizing his scarf as he replies: ""I like company when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud. The skull just attracts attention, so…"" John smiles briefly. Sherlock is putting on his scarf when he asks: ""Problem?"" John turns around to Sherlock and says: ""Yeah, Sergeant Donovan."" Sherlock has finished putting on his scarf when he looks away in exasperation and asks: ""What about her?"" John says: ""She said… You get off on this. You enjoy it."" Sherlock smirks and nonchalantly says: ""And I said 'Dangerous,' and here you are."" Immediately he turns and walks out of the door. John sits thoughtfully for a few seconds, then says: ""Damn it!"" as he roughly leans onto his cane to push himself to his feet and head for the door. ",50
