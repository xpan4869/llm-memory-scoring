2,The show begins with a dream from scenes from Afghanastan and solders shouting
3,and then  Dr John Watson awakes in his room distressed.  He is an Iraq war veteran shot in the leg
4,and it is clear that he is haunted by  his dreams from Afghanastan and it seems like he is living out his days in  the same routine.   An empty life as he adjusts to  civilian life
5,"we see him talking to his therapist   she suggests he write a blog of his experience. He replies nothing happens to him,  so his life is pretty uneventful"
6,
7,"at the same time we see some scenes a woman in an office building talking on the cell phone to a guy walking through a train station, well dressed.  Talking about taking a cab to meet  her   She says she loves him and he said he will be there soon."
8,But the next scene is   an abandoned office building on an empty floor  after taking some pills and he ends up confusing before dying.
9,"There is a press conference with his wife , who is  a different woman,  she talks about his life.  Then  we see the women who was talking with him on the phone.  So it  seems like there was an affair."
10,Then we see two young men  walking home  trying to catch a cab.  One says he is going back to his house to get something quickly.
11,The one who left is at a train station on a bridge. He is looking very distressed. He is opening a vial or container with the same type of pills and he ends up taking one. So he ends up as an alleged suicide as well.
12,
13,"So then later, at some point in the show, there is a press conference with the Police Chief.  The press is asking about the deaths.  The chief says they are suicides but feels that they are some how connected.  Everyone receives a text that says wrong.  The police chief goes on to talk about the deaths."
14,Then we catch up with John Watson who is in the park talking with a friend that he is looking for a flat.  The friend says that he is the second person who asked him that today.  So through  that Watson  meets Sherlock Holmes.
15,"The first time we see him he is in a morgue or crime lab.  He is talking to a lab technician who  has a crush on him and he doesn't pick up on her cues.    But he has unorthodox methods, he starts beating the body.  So maybe he is trying to recreate physical trauma from a crime. So clearly he is very unorthodox."
16,"When he is in the lab Watson walks in with his friend.  They have a short conversation.   Sherlock  kind of assumes he will be his flat mate and roommate .   Watson says ,  they don't know each other.  But then Sherlock rattles off some things he deduces from meeting him.    Without explanation he knows he is a military   doctor, and his limp is psycho sematic and senses tough family relations between Watson and his brother."
17,
18,Before the show we see the same pills in a container  on the floor and saw a woman's hand reaching down for them but we did not see the woman.    We had some advanced warning of this additional death.
19,"Later we see Watson arriving at the flat that he and Watson are going to share,  They go upstairs and it is pretty messy, Sherlock has taken over the flat with all of his stuff--lab equipment, folders, skull on the mantel. He is a pretty quirky guy."
20,
21,
22,He sees the police car outside and realizes there has been another murder.   The police chief arrive and asks him to come and check it out.
23,
24,Sherlock says he wants an assistant but seems very excited about it.    He ends up taking Watson with him.  Watson goes from dull life to getting on to the crime.
25,"They end up in a taxi to the crime scene.   Watson asks  him how he deduced so many things about his life.   Sherlock mentions about his tan, the way he limbs and when Watson handed him the cell phone he noticed an engraving on the back of the phone.  And the phone was a gift.  The family member ended the spouse and the phone was a gift from the family member."
26,"He also surmised the family member was a alcoholic because there  was scratch around the charging port  which when you are drunk can happen. Because they are clumsier.  The relationships between Watson and his family member was very strained.  Watson was impressed.  Sherlock gets wrong the sibling , the name harry on the back of the phone was actually for Harriet.    So it was his lesbian sister that had broken up with her partner."
27,At the crime scene at a house on the way in he has a testy exchange with one of the detectives.  He can tell that the detectives and the forensic person were having an affair.
28,
29,
30,They go upstairs and their is a woman dressed in a pink suit lying face down on the floor.    It looks lie with her left finger nail   she had tried to scribble out Rachel on the  floor it looks lie she was able to write R A C H E .
31,
32,He asks watson to examine the body and Watson deduces it was a stranglation and asphyxiation.
33,"Sherlock realizes this is German for revenge but thought it was more like she was trying to spell our RACHEL.    He quickly wipes his finger against her coat.  He notices that her umbrella is dry.  He sees that her wedding ring looks old so he figures she has been married for like 10 yrs.   But the ring is dirty and  the ring is smooth and polish on the inside.  HE believes it means she is a serial adulterer.  He looks up weather in the region and she was from Cardiff , she had been walking in th rain,  because her coat was wet but her umbrella was dry.  "
34,He also says she should have a suitcase because her legs have some mud.  He assumes she was rolling a bag behind her.  He figures it is pink like her coat.
35,"Sherlock ends up running out of the room and has a ureaka moment.  He says he thinks they are murders not suicides.  He runs off to find the suitcase, leaving Watson alone and he comes out of the building and asks  the police detective early where he can find a car.    She warns Watson that Sherlock is psycho pathetic because he likes murder and crime scenes.    She hints that Sherlock might be committing the crimes."
36,Watson he walks home and he hears a pay phone ring when a third one rings he answers.  The voice says look  at security  cameras across the street and then asks him to get in the car.
37,"He does and he goes off  In the car he talks to a woman who is trans fixed  by her cell phone.   He asks what her name is and she gives him a fake name, He asks where are they going and she doesn't answer."
38,He goes to a warehouse where he meets a  man that says he is the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock has. This man says he considers himself to be Sherlock's arch enemy.
39,He offers Watson money to provide information on Sherlock's activities.   Watson refuses.
40,"The man asks Watson to hold out his left hand and notices that Watson usually has a tremor.   He shows Watson that he likes pressure tht is why his hand is not shaking.    He is not haunted with PTSD.    He misses the experiences, he is cooler under pressure.  That is a turning point for Watson."
41,
42,He ends up driving back to his apartment  that he first is in and picks up a pistol
43,He makes a quick pass at the woman but she is not interested.  She doesn't go for it.
44,He goes back to the  apartment and find Sherlock with three nicotine patches on his arm so he thinks he has some sort of addiction.
45,Sherlock asks him to send a text message of the woman who died.  Watson is a little miffed.  Sherlock had been sending him text messages when he was wisked away by this guy.     Watson is wondering what is the fuss about.  He sends off the message asks him to.
46,He told  Sherlock he met his arch enemy he doesn't seem too interested  and then asks him which one of my enemies.   Says he offered me money to spy on you.  When Watson said he did not except it Sherlock says  we could have split the money.
47,He has the suitcase in the apartment but says the cell phone is missing.    The number he texted was the number of the dead woman.    So the killer should have her phone.
48,"Sherlock gets up and Sherlock found the pink suitcase.  Sherlock says he realized the killer would have wanted to put the suitcase somewhere , hide it somewhere he ended up going to , Cardiff or I don't  remember.  He ends up finding the suitcase in the dumpster."
49,Then shortly after Watson gets a phone call  and it is a withheld number and they think it is the killer calling back.  Sherlock wanted to confuse the  killer.  The message was  something only the dead woman could send.  The killer takes the bait.  
50,  Sherlock says then we have more business to do.  Watson says do you want me to go too.    Sherlock says you came back even though  I said it would be dangerous.   So Watson is back in this dangerous environment.    He realizes he is up for it and looks forward for it.  The segment ends with them leaving the flat to track things down and that is it.
