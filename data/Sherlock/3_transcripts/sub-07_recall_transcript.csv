2,The episode begins in one of Watson's dreams he is having a dream about the war. It's a nightmare and very violent
3,and he wakes up in a cold sweat and is very distraught and begins to sob.
4,
5,I believe the next scene he is talking to his therapist about his issue with post traumatic stress. He reads something she write upside down and she makes a comment why did you do that.
6,
7,"We see a montage of people killing themselves , a blond woman on the phone, a businessman and they seem happy"
8,"then we cut to a scene where we see a capsule with white granuals and pink poka dots. Then we see him hudled in a fetal position in a gutted warehouse, apartment building or office."
9,"Then the scene cuts back to his wife , not the blond lady, speaking of the suicide and can't believe he killed himself."
10,The next montage a young man killing himself he is with his friend in the rain says he is going back to get his umbrella.
11,We cut to a scene where he is ingesting the same capsules.
12,"Then a third middle aged woman's birthday party. There is two a woman and a man , is she still singing? They are referring to the woman. Then it cuts to the scene of this middle aged woman ingesting the same pills."
13,
14,"After the scene with the therapist, he is walking out of the office and he runs into a friend so they sit down on a park bench to have some coffee it comes out that Watson is looking for a flat. He doesn't have a lot of money so his friend brings him to Sherlock Holmes flat."
15,We see Sherlock doing some work on some type of science experiments.
16,"So he let's him come in , and they go into Sherlock's office or lab Sherlock has to borrow a phone so Watson offers his phone. At some point Sherlock deduces Watson is there because he needs a flat mat. Watson is surprised that Sherlock deduces he needs a flat mate and wonders how he does this. Sherlock always asks Watson Iraq or Afghanastan? Watson wonders how he knows that he was in the war. Watson is very credulous at first and then Sherlock shows his deduction skills by drawing a bunch of conclusions about how Watson stands and hold his head. Sherlock paints a picture of Watson's life."
17,
18,
19,"Now we are back to reality to present time. Sherlock and Watson agree to go look at a flat together, I think it is 122B Baker Street. They go to see this apartment, Sherlock somehow knows the land lady who he made sure her husband got the death penalty and she was appreciate of that. They go in and look at the apartment. Watson says it is a mess at this time but could work. There is some beakers on the kitchen table and books all around."
20,
21,
22,From there we see a police car outside the window and there has been a fourth suicide and the police chief comes in and Sherlock says what is different about this one because you wouldn't have come to me if this was the same as the others. The police chief says you know how they never leave a note? Well this one did. and so Sherlock gets really excited he knows it is a murder at this point.
23,"Sherlock leaves the room and Watson asks the land lady for a cup of tea and she says just this once and I am not your housekeeper, he asks for biscuits and she says I am not your housekeeper."
24,"Then Sherlock comes back for some reason, and says he needs a assistant so Watson goes with him. They go to an abandoned house"
25,
26,
27,before Sherlock goes into the house he runs into a female that is one of the investigators. I guess you didn't make it home last night. He walks up to this other investigator and says his deodorant is for men. Then Sherlock says so does she. He insinuates they are having affair. That was out of order. Back to the dead woman in the room.
28,
29,
30,The crime scene is a woman in a pink overcoat and in her mid 40's
31,Sherlock starts feeling the coat and it is wet. Something else is dry . Some of her jewelry is clean and her wedding ring isn't clean but the underside is which she takes it off a lot which means she is having an affair. He is drawing conclusions about her.
32,
33,"He is able to deduce she must be in the media because she is wearing a weird color pink, HE deduces that she must have traveled 3 hours away. Because her coat is wet. Sherlock is excited and he knows there is a serial killer. He runs down the stairs. How do you know and something about the color pink."
34,
35,
36,I forgot this part where earlier after the crime scene Watson is walking home and every pay phones starts ringing. So he picks up the third one and this weird guy on the phone tells him to get in the car.
37,So he gets in and they take him to a warehouse where he meets this guy in a suit.
38,HE says he is Sherlock's nemisis and offer him money to spy on him.
39,But he refuses the offer.
40,Then he makes a comment about his tremors being gone because he likes pressure.
41,
42,
43,
44,
45,He calls the serial killer with her phone. He said what happened I must of blacked out. He makes Watson drive across town to send the text message for him. Watson is a little annoyed but he sends the text and gets a call back.
46,Watson reveals back at Sherlock's apartment Sherlock is getting ready to leave. Watson lets him know that everyone is saying he should stay away from Sherlock.
47,
48,"We are back at Sherlock's apartment and he is , we see a flash back to him digging through some garbage and know has the suitcase. She had to have a suitcase because of spray marks. The serial killer disposed of it and Sherlock finds it in a dumpster."
49,He said a normal person would not have called back a text but the killer would. So they think they know whee the guy is and Sherlock gets excited again. He puts his coat and scarf on.
50,Watson lets him know that everyone is saying he should stay away from Sherlock. Sherlock says something like I told you in that text it is dangerous and you are still here this is exciting let's go do this.
